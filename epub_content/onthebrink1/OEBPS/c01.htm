<h1 class="chapter">I<br/>Introduction</h1>
<p class="indent">If you were to imagine all the change that had occurred from the year 1992 to the year 2012, and juxtapose that with the change that had occurred from 5000 BC to 4980 BC, you would obviously see that far more events that changed the entire outlook of the Earth have occurred in these last twenty years than could have ever taken place between 5000 and 4980 BC. This naturally leads us to wonder as to whether there are any trends or data that could possibly account for and describe this extremely Earth-shifting phenomenon. We would look to see if there were any explanations for what could be described as <em>a rapidly accelerating pace of change</em>, a speed of advancement which once moved very laggardly in the ancient era, but in our modern day spawns entire globally coordinated social movements which can spread throughout the whole world within in just a matter of months, a phenomenon which took place from December of 2010<a id="fn1" href="bib.htm#ft1"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> to October of 2011.<a id="fn2" href="bib.htm#ft2"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">If we were to look into physics we would find that there is in fact an explanation for this, one which would at first seem impossible, but soon after it was understood would be realized to harbor major significance in our look towards the coming years. This trend, the rapidly accelerating pace of change, is in fact an <em>exponential</em> trend, a mathematical term which we will dig into in a few short moments to understand what it really entails. The primary explanation behind this change manifesting at speeds never seen before in history is due to a literal slowing down of time itself. Understanding how this is possible is crucial when formulating our conception of what the world will come to be in the upcoming years.</p>
<p class="indent">This phenomenon, the literal slowing down of time, is described in physics and draws from Einstein&#x2019;s theory of the relatively of time. What this trend being exponential means is that not only is time itself slowing down, but it is slowing down at a rate which began very gradually in ancient times but in the last decade has begun to screech to a figurative halt--and that from this point onwards the trend will only continue picking up in magnitude and strength. To understand exactly how powerful it will become, we need to first examine what an exponential curve really is, which we will do in the next few pages, but first&#x2014;an explanation.</p>
<p class="indent">Time can be said to be slowing down because an ever increasing amount of events that <em>change the process of the entire world</em> happen in an ever decreasing amount of time. <a id="fn3" href="bib.htm#ft3"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a> The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the amount of time needed to exist between these literal Earth-shifting events occurring is perpetually shrinking, which from the point of view of physics means time itself is slowing.<a id="fn4" href="bib.htm#ft4"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a><sup class="frac">,</sup> <a id="fn5" href="bib.htm#ft5"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The frequency of events that change the entire process of the world is skyrocketing, in ever shortening periods of time. The conclusion from this is that time is slowing, yet this only applies in a purely objective examination of time. In the <em>subjective</em> sense, which is of course the way in which we personally experience reality, it seems like the opposite is true. During this whole period, it <em>feels</em> to us like the world is going faster and faster; revolutions spawn and sweep across the entire world in mere months, technologies emerge and become obsolete in a matter of years, while news that changes the entire course of the future comes out on nearly a weekly basis.</p>
<p class="indent">The truth is that these trends that we will be examining: the exponential rate of resource depletion, the exponential debt accumulation in our economic systems and the exponential growth of computer technology have all been around for long periods of time, but were slowly just scraping by. It is the nature of exponential trends that they creep along slowly for thousands, even millions of years, but then begin to pick up in speed; first slowly, then quicker, then quicker yet, and once they reach a certain critical point they begin to speed up to an almost unfathomable pace. For whatever reason that we have been born in the era that we have be it fate, destiny, random chance, the fact remains that we have been placed smack dab in the middle of these curves as they go from &#x2018;very quick&#x2019; to &#x2018;incomprehensibly quick&#x2019; and we will, in this generation, live to see a world in which these trends shoot up vertically, meaning time has slowed down beyond what any human has ever experienced before.</p>
<p class="indent">In this new world, more changes in a single year than has in the first hundred thousand years of civilization, entire paradigms can be birthed and die off in short time and we will be living in a reality which literally no human can even comprehend at this point. We indisputably live in an era unlike any other in human history&#x2014;with none other, I would argue, placing a close second. And we can already see this change beginning to manifest.</p>

<p class="indent">There are now over 47,000,000 Americans living on food stamps&#x2014;or in other words&#x2014;being subsidized by the government to survive. The once held image of America as the beacon of Western economic strength, and the idea of the &#x2018;American Dream&#x2019; are both examples of concepts once fundamental to our reality, but which have been shattered since the financial collapse seen world-wide in 2007. However, the changing landscape in the United States is only the smaller piece of the much larger world picture. Civil unrest seen at unprecedented rates across the world, food riots, massive bail-outs and possible dissolutions of governments, revolutions: these are the phenomenon which are exemplary of our era. Again, many of the perceptions we had once held, the stability of the global financial system, the value of the writ-large embracing of the consumerist &#x2018;Western Way Of Life&#x2019;, the permanency of our economic and political systems&#x2014;these ideas have been disintegrating as the world is forced to come to grips with a new reality and a new future.</p>
<p class="indent">A civilization built around a fuel source which is becoming increasingly inaccessible, a doomed financial system trapped in a vicious cycle of exponential debt growth, and the ever increasing speed of the rise of computerized Supertechnology, these are the trends which are budding out of an exponential slowing of time. These are also the stories which the mainstream, corporate media will never report on, and without outspoken voices, the public will never be made aware of. Becoming one of those outspoken voices myself goes back to a process which began all the way back in October of 2011.</p>
<p class="indent">After having watched the upheavals in early 2011 of Tunisian president Ben Ali and the more reported overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, I became very intrigued with the fact that social movements, aiming for regime change, had been springing up throughout not only North Africa, but also Europe. In Iceland the country&#x2019;s parliament building was pelted with rocks during a movement which upended their regime.<a id="fn6" href="bib.htm#ft6"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a> Spain was having demonstrations,<a id="fn7" href="bib.htm#ft7"><sup class="frac">7</sup></a> as were the Greeks,<a id="fn8" href="bib.htm#ft8"><sup class="frac">8</sup></a> and then the Occupy movement spread world-wide,<a id="fn9" href="bib.htm#ft9"><sup class="frac">9</sup></a> of which I took part in during its tenure in Vancouver.</p>
<p class="indent">In keeping a close eye on the development of the Occupy movement I witnessed the activists being viciously attacked with explicit military force in the United States and other countries throughout Europe and Africa. I saw the way these movements were brutally undermined by the political institutions both abroad and here in Canada. I witnessed, and experienced first-hand, the way the corporate media would twist facts and participate in shoddy journalism, the way the politicians in the city would manipulate the situation for personal gain during times of elections, and the general crushing of a social movement by &#x2018;the powers that be&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="indent">At the same time, evidence was surfacing that the movement was highly infiltrated and was being directly influenced by saboteurs, working to undermine the message of the group. Needless to say, my eyes had been yanked open. I could not believe, nor understand, why a group of politically engaged citizens, dissenting over a completely valid argument of economic and political injustice would be so opposed and denigrated during their efforts. As the cold weather and constant downpour of Vancouver moved in during the winter, I could hardly believe the change in perception which had occurred within me during a short span of two or three months.</p>
<p class="indent">After I had come back down to Earth after my several month adrenaline fuelled spree of activism, I had a very deep feeling of motivation and inspiration. I could not, and rightly so, shake the feeling that something huge was happening across the world. The Occupy encampments had been brutally cracked down on all across America, the most notorious being in Zucotti Park during the 15<sup class="frac">th</sup> of November, 2011. The Democrats under Obama had chosen to use the method of violent repression to quell a movement, despite using harsh rhetoric against the very same act during their lashing of Hosni Mubarak earlier just that year. During this time, as I kept a close eye on America and the unrest rippling throughout Europe, I began an undertaking which has led me to writing this book. I began to study deeply the financial system we live under, the economic system which we subscribe to (and I am taught in university), the underlying social factors contributing to this huge social unrest, and the history surrounding popular movements, especially those which have come out of financial calamities. I studied the trends that happened historically the last time we were in a depression of this magnitude, which would of course be the Great Depression of the 1930s. It should be noted too that the verdict is still out as to whether or not the era we have adopted financially now is in fact worse than the Great Depression, and indeed only a retrospective look will allow us to tell for certain, but as I will demonstrate throughout this book, the factors surrounding our current situation definitely make a case for this being a more dreaded outlook of a future than that which was borne out of the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="indent">However, an analyzing of economics is only a fraction of this work. The entire book will be based on four major sections; firstly, we will analyze the facts surrounding limited and depleting natural resources and the implications of this. Secondly, a wide-ranging economic examination will be done while looking at the deeply flawed and ultimately unsustainable financial system. Thirdly, we will explore a topic which is largely going unnoticed but yet is transforming the world in a pace similar to those of the other trends explored in this book, which is the exponential growth of computing power and what that truly means and encompasses. Lastly, in the final and concluding chapter I will piece together all of these trends and describe what the information indicates to me will occur over the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p class="indent">I began to write this book when I reached a point where I had learned so much crucial information that I felt I had a strong imperative and responsibility to try and distribute that information en masse to those looking for an explanation of these topics but who lacked had the time or the opportunity to conduct the necessary amount of research. At first it was a simple curiosity which drove me to study these topics, but soon after I felt a pressing impulse that there was a real potential for people to be hurt if they were unaware of what was happening in the world. Essentially, I felt that having the proper information could at some point literally become the difference between life and death for someone. It may sound hyperbolic to say that, but it would not seem like such a stretch to those who purchased homes on the premise that the prices would rise forever, and now see themselves forced into bankruptcy and foreclosure across the United States and the world. So although I have not written this to be a how-to survival guide, it was fully intended for the information in this book to allow the readers to protect themselves, and move from a view of the world that would result in major hardships into a view of the world that can instead result in security and safety.</p>
<p class="indent">That being said, my intention is to deliver the truth, and only the truth. I will not be mincing words, or exaggerating and speaking in hyperboles. The topics inside this book will not be sugar-coated or fluffed up or &#x2018;manoeuvred&#x2019; around. They will be simply explained, in a way to make it as informative as possible. I don&#x2019;t have to talk-up the biggest technological transition in human history or use extraneous words to make a collapse of a system appear both intriguing and horrifying. And with that, let&#x2019;s begin.</p>
