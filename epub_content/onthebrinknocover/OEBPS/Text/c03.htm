      <p class="center">“Current trends form future realities” – Gerald Celente</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">The populist uprisings that took place across the world in 2011 happened on a scale unprecedented in human history. I know of no other time in history where a globally coordinated day of action happened simultaneously across all inhabited continents, all with a single rallying cry--yet that is exactly what happened on October 15 of 2011. On that day I was spending most of my time trying to, along with about 7 or 8 tech-savvy activists who had descended upon the Vancouver Art gallery, convert a space under a tree into a functioning media center where we could bring the news of what was happening in front of us: namely six thousand people marching through the streets of Vancouver, and get those sounds, that imagery, out via the internet to people across the world.</p>

    <p class="indent">I would hear from others as we were typing away on laptops and trying to configure a wireless network about news happening across the globe. There were stories of riots and windows being broken in Greece—a scene that has become all too familiar by now. But for the most part the engagements were peaceful and went smoothly. When I returned home late in the night, I scoured through the internet, finding videos of people marching through the streets in Japan, Egypt, Germany and from coast to coast in the United States and in Canada. All of these people felt fundamentally that something was changing in their world, that the value of human life had been abandoned in an era where the citizens had been made to suffer by the hands of cronyists and so-called ‘leaders’ whose interests had been long since decoupled from those of their populace.</p>

    <p class="indent">These events have undoubtedly been historic, but I am forced to wonder how many people truly understand the mechanics of what is driving them into such destitution and poverty? I imagine that those who are out marching in the streets and performing acts of civil disobedience, who certainly recognize that something is wrong have a generally much greater understanding than their fellow countrymen, but again, on average, how well does the typical person grasp the concepts that I will work to cover in this book? They undoubtedly appreciate that something is amiss, and they are tapping into something that is very real, despite their not being able to put it into words. They feel that the world is shifting beneath their feet; that the possibility (or necessity) for real change is right around the corner, and they are right. Certain paradigms and systems will have to be reconstructed as the old ways of economic organization begin to crumble in the face of certain inevitable physical realities. However, most of the population, even those who believed they are kept generally well informed, perhaps as they read the corporate media, are very unaware of these realities and very unprepared to face them when they finally arise. Let me give an example.</p>

    <p class="indent">While I was at home visiting my during the 2012 New Year, I had seen a piece on television done by the CBC about poverty in the United States. Specifically, they were looking at the city of Cleveland, and the amount of bank foreclosures that had taken place there, forcing people out what they assumed was their own homes and onto the streets. Cleveland too is a city that was once regarded as a bastion of the American economy, possessing factories which produced great amounts of American vehicles, but was left crippled in the wake of the financial and economic crash which began in 2007 with the collapse of the investment firm Lehman Brothers.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the CBC piece they were showing how in neighborhoods where home values had collapsed and dropped 50, 60, sometimes 70%, banks had hired personnel to take tractors to demolish many of these now vacant homes. What they were finding was that when these homes sat vacant they would reduce the value of the surrounding homes to such a large degree that it was economically prudent to in fact just demolish the whole thing and leave instead an empty lot. During the piece they interviewed a black woman from Cleveland, who, with desperation clear in her voice, was simply hoping that “Obama will get this turned around”.</p>

    <p class="indent">Could she understand the underlying factors that had been pushing her and so many of her fellow Americans deeper and deeper into poverty? Certainly she could, if she was granted the right education, the right research, a proper explanation of what was really happening. I felt a real sense of hopelessness watching her, with great uncertainty in her eyes trying to hold on searching for, an economic foothold in a country where the poor and middle class had seen the ‘American Dream’ vaporize in front of their very eyes, helplessly putting her hopes into a man who had on December 31<sup class="frac">st</sup> of 2011 signed a bill allowing for the <em>indefinite</em> detention of American citizens on American soil to be held without trial nor due process, in a military prison, for again: indefinite detention (I reference here the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011). I wished that I could be magically transported there, that I could sit down with her and actually try and spell out many of the things I had learned and researched. I wished that I could explain to her what I will explain in this book, to grant her the ability to understand her situation and ultimately protect herself from the further turmoil headed her way.</p>

    <p class="indent">Alas, I could not, and that person is probably still today, unless she by now has received better information, continuing to put her faith in a demagogue which will sadly not be coming to her avail. I cannot personally assist that person, unless by some stroke of luck this book lands in her lap. What I can do is take what I would have told her, the most important information that could help her understand and begin to protect herself, and get it onto paper for others to see.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, learning this information is not without consequence. When moving one’s perspective from that which is based more on speculation and perhaps misinformation and ignorance, to a perspective that is composed of sometimes harsh truths and unadulterated reality, that while at first it can be very difficult and even at some points disturbing, in the end it is an extremely healthy exercise. As it has been said “you can ignore reality, but you cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality”.</p>

    <p class="indent">With this book, I sincerely hope that you as the reader can be made more aware, more in tune with certain truths of the world. In a more casual sense it will allow you live a life that is happier and more based on unvarnished truth and fact, all the way to a more extreme sense where knowing the difference between reality and fiction could at one point allow you to make decisions which could realistically save your life. If a decision you made allowed you to avoid financial collapse, ignoring the poverty of the greatest depression since THE Great Depression, and would allow you to live comfortably and happily during some of the most turbulent times mankind has ever faced—I would say that is a life saved. A life lost could, to me, be a person desperate and without bearings on reality, facing extreme economic destitution and hoping fruitlessly for help from above, a cry for help which goes unheeded.</p>

    <p class="indent">But back the woman in Cleveland. If I could sit down with her, and try to spell out from the beginning the most important things she has to know moving forward, I would begin with this…..</p>

    <p class="center1"><span class="underline">Reality Does Not Negotiate</span></p>

    <p class="indent">To understand the world and what is driving it, one must familiarize themselves with a concept that even I myself took an unusually lengthy amount of time to look into deeply, <span class="underline">,</span> and that is the concept of energy. Energy—the ability to do work.</p>

    <p class="indent">When we think of energy, it is not difficult to come at it from the perspective of a person, a human being. We all know the feeling of not having any energy, being so tired that you are just unwilling to do much of anything, except perhaps accept some passive entertainment. When a human such as you or I are looking for some energy we turn to our main source of energy, which is the food we consume. We know that a meal will pick you up if you’re feeling drowsy, but we have to look a little deeper than that. We need to look at it in terms of biology.</p>

    <p class="indent">Gasoline is the fuel source for combustion vehicles, whereas food matter is the food source in the human body. In both of these methods of acquiring energy, the matter is broken down via a process (combustion for vehicles, digestion for humans) into a usable energy which can be used by either a motor in the example of the car, or the human body in the example of we as humans. Therefore, both humans and combustion engines use a process that converts stored energy contained within matter, which is the fuel source, into a usable energy that they can use for power over a given period of time.</p>

    <p class="indent">For most of our history, humans have had a relatively simple (compared to today’s standards) relationship with energy. They would consume plants, which would receive their energy primarily from the sun, and animals, which would mostly receive their energy from eating plants or other animals (this may ring some bells from elementary school about the food chain and the food pyramid).</p>

    <p class="indent">The important thing to realize is that the way humans garnered energy from the land was very in tune with nature and the other species on the planet; we would simply consume animal or plant matter and turn that fuel into energy by the process of digestion. But we as a species, for whatever reason, were not destined to remain as simple animals, and using our trademark cunning and ingenuity were able to find fuel sources other than food, and convert those fuels into energy through ways other than digestion.</p>

    <p class="indent">This transition away from our primary source of energy being food was kicked off with the introduction of burning trees. Yes, chopping and burning trees was our first step in a long journey towards alternative sources of fuel. With this new paradigm came another transition: we were able to step outside our normal limiting factor: energy, which in pre-industrial times meant limits on food production and consumption. The human population was no longer pegged to a reality of agricultural food supply and we were able from that point on to create and sustain human population on a scale which had been unseen by that of our ancestors. There was a simple problem though that was inevitably run into, one which might ring a few bells today, that being the fact that <em>they began to run out of their fuel source</em>.</p>

    <p class="indent">Trees were being cut down at an incredibly rapid pace, there was unprecedented environmental destruction and at a certain point a change was needed to be made. Humans again, being the cunning creatures that we are, and with our backs against the wall came up with a new solution. As the amount of energy we were accessing from trees began to taper and fall, we had come up with a wittier way of fuelling our hunger for energy, which ended up to be the burning of coal. It is interesting to note now that although we still use wood to burn, it is no longer a significant source of energy for the Western world, however coal most certainly is. It is a relatively unknown fact, but the United States actually uses coal to generate 50% of its nation’s electricity.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft10" id="fn10"><sup class="frac">10</sup></a> In mainland China, the figure is 80%.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft11" id="fn11"><sup class="frac">11</sup></a> The reason we have not abandoned coal is out of simple necessity, this despite the fact that the amount of usable energy actually created in the form of electricity from the combustion of coal is only 35% <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft12" id="fn12"><sup class="frac">12</sup></a>, which means that the large majority of energy created from the combustion of coal is wasted. Remember that even after the point at which we have converted 35% of coal’s energy into electricity, the electricity must be transferred across power lines, through transformers, and ultimately to people’s homes—processes which all require energy in and of themselves. To fund today’s appetite for energy, and to build an international empire which manufactures and transports goods from all areas of the world to all other areas of the world, another fuel source was and continues to be needed—one much more powerful than coal. This fuel source goes by many names, black gold, fossil fuel, Devil’s tar or its colloquial name and as it’s more commonly known: oil.</p>

    <p class="center1">“We’ve embarked on the beginning of the last days of oil”<br />
    – Mike Bowlin, CEO of ARCO</p>

    <p class="indent">You may have commonly heard the phrase “money makes the world go round”. This is in a certain respect true, but the more accurate phrase would be that “energy makes the world go round” by today’s standards, that can be simply summarized as “oil makes the world go round.” After I describe to you the amount of processes by which we rely on oil to perform, and connect that with the proven fact that we are running out of oil supply in the world at a hastening pace, the implications begin to become harrowing. Although it may be difficult to fully come to grips with, to underestimate the amount of influence oil has on creating the modern ‘Western’ style of life would be absolutely foolish. Let me give some examples.</p>

    <p class="indent">In economics, for decades the overarching strategy employed has been that of ‘globalization’, that being economic integration on a world scale. This takes advantage of two things: wage arbitrage (moving production to areas with the cheapest cost of production, typically poorer countries) and cross-continental transportation. All the goods that are shipped from China to North America are done so by taking advantage of cargo ships whose size is nearly incomprehensible to the average person, which can only make their journey worthwhile by using, which remains for the time being, inexpensive oil.</p>

    <p class="indent">We use gasoline to power our vehicles and our planes. Without that petroleum, or more accurately with petroleum too expensive to afford, we would not be able to transport ourselves or goods across great distances. Without oil our global ‘just-in-time’ delivery network ceases to function.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, these are just some of the more commonly understood and appreciated uses of oil. When looking at the amount of goods produced from oil, there is no limit to the amount of things to choose from. Honestly, the lists go on and on, and I would suggest that to fully comprehend the sheer number of products produced from oil that you poke around on the internet and try and find some (I will post at the end of this book a list of great sources). Everything from detergents and dish soaps to rubber tires and car bodies; ammonia, anaesthetics, lotions, shampoos, solvents, antifreeze, ballpoint pens, paint—these all require oil in their production. Indeed, the foundation from which our entire civilization and style of life is built on is that of oil, and more specifically, cheap oil. And when you realize that that foundation is in fact shifting below our very feet while balanced on a dangerous precipice, you begin to realize that humanity is on a collision course with physical reality and that a rude awakening is nearly upon us.</p>

    <p class="center1">“The American way of life is non-negotiable”<br />
    – Dick Cheney</p>

    <p class="center1">“We need an oil policy that encourages consumption”<br />
    – George Bush</p>

    <p class="center1">“Dick Cheney says that the American way of life<br />
    is non-negotiable. That’s true.<br />
    Reality is not going to negotiate with you.”<br />
    – Nicole Foss</p>

    <p class="indent">It makes sense that humans have come to use oil for so many different things, considering that the substance itself is extremely energy dense and versatile. But let’s just imagine for a moment, to fully illustrate the power of oil and why we have come to be so dependent on it, that we had to push a car 20 kilometres. Imagine the sheer amount of effort and strength it would take. It would seem impossible, yet that is what we are able to achieve with only 1.3 L of gasoline, which in Canada would cost you around $1.50. Does that put things into perspective?</p>

    <p class="indent">In fact, a gallon of gasoline (which is directly derived from oil) is capable to achieve the work of 6 weeks hard human labour. And that’s only a gallon—how much do we fill our cars with every time we stop at the pump? <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft13" id="fn13"><sup class="frac">13</sup></a> To take the human labor analogy a step further, based on oil consumption, the average American has the equivalent of over 150 “energy slaves” working for them 24 hours a day.<em><a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft14" id="fn14"><sup class="frac">14</sup></a></em> That is unheard of by historical standards—there is no way you can achieve that with horses or other livestock. When looking at the long history of civilization, you find that this is nearly unlimited amount of energy derived from oil is completely unprecedented, and in fact as we will find in the evidence, based on usage alone, it is completely unsustainable.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="block"><em>[In 1986 a barrel of oil was $6. In 2008, before<br />
      the economic collapse, a barrel of oil was $147. That<br />
      is a 2500% increase in price in just 22 years]</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">There are two key concepts that must be understood when looking at the future of oil in our society. The first is the concept of <em>energy-returned-on-energy-invested</em> or <em>EROEI</em>. It is true that just like the amount of energy you can acquire from burning coal differs from that capable to be produced from oil, the amount of energy you can produce from oil also differs between different kinds of oil. The best quality is Light Sweet Crude, the largest reserves of which are found in Libya. In terms of energy returns, the worst quality oil is that extracted from tar sands. This means that there are huge swings in the amount of energy you can actually ascertain from any given amount of oil, depending on the type you are producing.</p>

    <p class="indent">In conjunction with this idea, the second concept that must be understood is the global supply of oil, which is intrinsically linked with the cost of production. This is because we have collectively reached and extracted the oil which is ‘the low hanging fruit’. This was done when there were large supplies of easily accessed oil left in the world. We extracted the best quality and easiest to access first and foremost (a very important concept). This means that increasingly, the oil we have had to extract is that from unconventional sources like the tar sands and off-shore such as what was being attempted with Deepwater Horizon. If you study the current trends of oil supply (production) and also the trends of our average energy returned on energy invested when examining oil, you will see a definite pattern emerge. With that in mind, we will certainly analyze both, but first we will look at the supply of oil remaining on the planet.</p>

    <p class="indent">The supply of oil produced globally has been progressing at a trajectory predicted accurately in the 1980s. This has been done by using the technique of a brilliant scientist and ex-Shell geologist, Marrion King Hubbert. Hubbert would be most well known for work he had done at the University of Chicago analyzing American oil reserves and consumption. In 1956, using his studies as his basis, he predicted that the peak of oil production in America would occur at some point between 1966 and 1972. Although this idea during 1956 was considered laughable, ultimately the last laugh was awarded to Hubbert, and he was vindicated as peak oil production occurred in America in the year 1970. Using the techniques pioneered by Hubbet, geologists have been able to create models for our depletion of global oil and have come up with a date at which point they believe global supply will have reached its maximum, or in other words will have peaked. If you can imagine that we are looking at a graph of oil production, the meaning of this is that every moment following the point in which we have passed peak production is a moment in which the world will have less total oil to use per year. This concept, of the eventual reach of a peak in oil production has been referred to as peak oil.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="block">“We are running the risk of another oil crisis when demand outstrips supply around 2014 or 2015. There won’t be enough oil and gas by the middle of the next decade.”</p>

      <p class="block">–Christophe de Margerie, CEO of Total, September 2009<br />
      <br /></p>

      <p class="block">“Long-term thinking is difficult in the current political crisis, when most politicians are obsessed by tomorrow’s headlines,…but our future as a country depends much more on our ability to plan ahead for the next oil shock and the post-oil world.”</p>

      <p class="block">–Vince Cable, British Liberal Democrat<br />
      Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, June 2009</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">It is possible to examine the statistics for crude oil <em>discovery</em> in a given country and see a chart demonstrating trajectory this trend takes invariably takes. The rate of discovery rises slowly, hit a top (peaks), and then rolls back down the other side. It is possible to compare these charts with a chart that plots the production of oil within that same given country. What is found is that the charts for oil discovery and the charts for oil supply look extremely similar, except they are separated by around 40 years, accounting for the time it takes to be drilled and refined after discovery. This is the method by which anyone is able to calculate and predict future oil production i.e. future oil supply. Hubbert came up with his range of years in predicting peak oil production in the United States from 1966-1972 by calculating the ‘ultimately recoverable reserves’ reserves in the country. He came up with two figures, one pessimistic (smaller amount of future discoveries) and one optimistic (larger amount of future discoveries), which ultimately led him to his range of 1966 to 1972. The peak again was in 1970.</p>

    <p class="indent">Using similar calculations, Hubbert also created dates for the peak of global crude production based on his predictions of future global recoverable reserves. Ultimately his guess in the 1970s was about a decade early. He predicted peak oil production would occur between 1990 and 2000, when it ultimately seems to have peaked in 2011. It should be noted that when the United States’ oil production peaked in 1970, it was not known with certainty until later in 1971.</p>

    <p class="indent">Hubbert’s prediction was ultimately off because he based his calculations on what was at the time inadequate data, and had minor methodological errors. However, his work certainly did not die with the man, as across the world geologists continue to use Hubbert’s methodology to make predictions of oil production peaks. They have also touched up on Hubbert’s methodological errors, and have been able to base their calculations on what is now much better sets of data. As previously mentioned, the calculations have differed, but a majority who have put forward a date for peak production ultimately peg it between 2010-2013, that is, they have chosen a year between 2010 and 2013 as the year that global oil supply will peak and begin its ultimate descent.</p>

    <p class="indent">The most unbelievable part of this story is that the topic is rarely, if ever, spoken about in the present day media. The mainstream’s coverage of this story has been limited and hushed, and politicians will not touch it, knowing politically it is death to the bearer of bad news (reality is hardly a rallying cry for election). Ironically, the first time people pushed for energy conservation and emphasized the fleeting supply of oil was in 1973, following the OPEC crisis. After Middle-Eastern oil producing countries had made an embargo on the United States for their support of Israel in the Yom Kippur war, there was a huge price spike in America. In nearly an instant, the price of oil quadrupled from $3 a barrel to around $12 a barrel. People were stretched out in long lines just trying to fill up. Then President Jimmy Carter, seeing the gravity of the situation and his country’s dependence on oil began to speak about the need for energy conservation and oil conservation. In 1977 President Carter spoke, saying “Because we are now running out of gas and oil, we must prepare quickly for a third change, to strict conservation and to the use of coal and permanent renewable energy sources, like solar power.” Sound eerily familiar? He even had solar panels installed on the roof of the White House.</p>

    <p class="indent">The direction of the country was permanently changed when Ronald Reagan won the presidency from Carter in 1981. He touted America’s strength as an oil producer and in a symbolic gesture of ‘American strength’ had the solar panels removed from the White House. In the next part of the book we will actually learn in comedic fashion that in fact America was on a harsh decline in terms of oil production, having to ever increase their vast amount of imported oil. This would ironically lead to the bankruptcy and oil wars that have now plagued and forever tarnished America’s reputation. Perhaps if President Carter’s words would have been heeded then today’s reality would look different. However, that was not the course that was taken and what we see now in the United States is a fledgling empire still very much addicted to foreign oil and very ill-prepared for the ultimate change that will be forced upon them. And this is not wishy-washy Obama feel-good change, but harsh and real change, as only Mother Nature knows how to deal.</p>

    <p class="indent">Like was mentioned before, there are not only different kinds of oil, but there are different kinds of extraction methods as well. The more normalized and commonly thought of source of oil is that of conventional oil, that is, you drill a well into the ground and pump the oil out of a large reservoir. That image I’m sure we can all picture of an oil rig oscillating and pumping out oil is the extraction technique that is usually pictured. However, this as we are probably all aware of, is not the only way that man has devised to extract oil from the Earth.</p>

    <p class="indent">More and more common now, out of simple necessity, is oil extracted from non-conventional sources. This includes off-shore, deep water oil drilling, like was seen in the huge and ongoing environmental disaster of British Petroleum’s Deepwater Horizon. This kind of drilling involves huge rigs that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, costs half a million dollars a day to run and which sit nearly a hundred kilometres off the shores of nations, while it drills for oil beneath the floor of the ocean.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another method used is the extracting of oil from the tar sands, like we see in Alberta. This kind of drilling is also extremely environmentally damaging and requires between 2.5 and 4 barrels of fresh water to produce a single barrel of oil fresh—fresh water that the world is running out of at an alarming rate (more on that in the book’s final chapter). To acquire oil using this method is extremely costly as it involves a method of removing nearly unimaginable quantities of sand out of the Earth and processing this sand by superheating it to extract the bitumen (tar) which can only then, after further refinement, be used as oil. The truth is that this convoluted process ends up using almost as much fossil fuel energy to produce the oil as it delivers in terms of oil that can be combusted for energy. This process also created massive ‘tailing ponds’, which amount to toxic lakes which we are told are waterproof and restrict seepage by the hired public relations of oil companies, although investigative journalism has proved that to be in fact a lie. Despite the environmental travesties of the oil sands, which would almost merit a book in itself, the point to be made and the overarching reality that we are left with is that the days of easily pumping out large amounts of liquid oil from gigantic reservoirs just under the surface of the ground is over.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another less commonly known method of energy extraction is that of fracking, which involves blowing up (fracturing) shale rock parts to extract the gas from within it. In terms of picking a winner out of these methods in terms of causing the most environmental destruction, it would be hard to choose one over the other, but ‘fracking’ as it’s known may actually prove to be the most costly in terms of pure environmental destruction. The now proven man-made earthquakes which are a byproduct of this type of natural gas extraction is the reason why many places, the State of Vermont being the latest, have made hydraulic fracturing illegal in all forms. Again, like the tar sands, the energy extracted from fracking as compared to that acquired from easily accessed conventional oil is also extremely inefficient. Fracking is simply another poor source of energy extraction, and one that will not suffice to fill the void left by depleting conventional oil.</p>

    <p class="indent">Nonconventional sources of oil give us an alternative to the easily pumped liquid crude oil of years past. In fact, there is enough oil trapped in the tar sands of Alberta to power all the world’s energy needs for many years to come. At least, that is how it would appear on the surface. Unfortunately, reality in this case is not as promising as some media pundits beholden to the oil lobby would lead you to believe. Besides the pure environmental destruction, which is difficult to quantify and will always remain a contentious issue in the business world, there are hard economic realities as to why the tar sands will never be able to save the world from its coming energy crisis. It comes back to the originally introduced term of energy-returned-on-energy invested.</p>

    <p class="indent">When pumping oil out of a reservoir, like was seen across Texas in the 50’s and 60’s, the energy gained on energy invested is absolutely staggering. It is no surprise to see how the US rose to such gargantuan economic heights during the time when it was the largest supplier of oil in the world. During the 1950’s, the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) was about 100 to 1. That means that for every 1 barrel worth of energy that was put into to retrieving this oil, 100 barrels worth of energy would be returned. The amount of dividends accrued on that is simply amazing—that is a 10000% return! If there was a process by which you could turn, let’s say $1 into $100, it would not be hard to amass a great fortune in a small amount of time. Multiply this by the knowledge of just how powerful this oil really is and you can see how industrial civilization and oil cartels have grown to such heights. With profit and power on the mind, the oil in Texas was pumped like there was no tomorrow, but unfortunately—there was.</p>

    <p class="indent">When we began pumping oil out of the ground we would naturally pick the most easily accessed and highest returning areas to work first—what you will commonly heard referred to as the ‘low hanging fruit’. After this easily accessible oil was found and extracted, people would go to greater lengths and dig deeper and wider looking for more oil. This has eventually culminated into the position we are in today, going to insane lengths trying to find and extract the last remainders of this extremely powerful form of matter. However, something very sinister has been taking place during all of this. The cost associated with extracting the oil has risen steadily and steadily as the low hanging fruit have all been plucked. The energy returned on energy invested has plummeted over the years, especially in America. In stark contrast to the 100 to 1 returns once seen in Texas, energy returned now is around 10 to 1 and quickly diminishing, with the tar sands returning an almost unfathomably low number of 3 to 1. Of course, as soon as the number reaches 1 to 1, the game is over.</p>

    <p class="indent">And now you know why gasoline is so [expletive] expensive, and will continue to follow a trend of becoming more difficult for average families to afford (I am careful not to say it will only rise in ‘price’, as price is contingent on the currency you pay with, which we will examine in the next part). Gasoline, a by-product of oil, will in fact continue to become scarcer and less easily afforded by the average family. This oil squeeze of course is not has huge implications for middleclass families, it is indeed the engine of our entire economic system. Our just in time world-wide delivery system is predicated on oil, cheap oil at that. All the food we consume, if we buy it at a chain store, has travelled unfathomably long distances, and we know how: it is not by electric cars, but rather gigantic gas guzzling trucks.</p>

    <p class="indent">This simple fact, found in data alone, cannot be overlooked when examining why growth of economies has plummeted. While I wrote this section, news had recently come out that the Canadian economy actually <em>shrunk</em> in February of 2012. If this trend continues, Canada will officially be in a recession in short time (the Canadian economy ‘grew’ by 0.1% in Q3). It had also been discovered that the UK too was in yet again another recession, characterized by two simultaneous losing quarters (and is now in a triple-dip recession). A list of countries facing extreme economic hardship is not difficult to create, off the top of my head we can throw in Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Portugal and of course the United States. Even China is facing a slowing in their growth and debate has sparked up as to whether or not they will have a ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ landing.</p>

    <p class="indent">Unfortunately, or perhaps thankfully—either way you look at it, economic growth <em>as it is known now</em> will and already has begun to cease to exist. Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Arabic states are beginning to invest in similar off-shore types of drilling. These countries have ceased discovering new sources of oil, and are rapidly depleting the ones that exist now. The most frightening indication of all of this, when you understand exactly how dependent the world as it is today is on oil, is that although supply has peaked and has begun now to make its descent, demand for oil has continued to steadily rise.</p>

    <p class="indent">This increase in demand from oil has not been from the West, especially not America and Canada. In fact, the demand for oil has actually decreased in both America and Canada since the economic collapse of 2008. The place where this growth in demand for oil is coming from is the so called ‘emerging’ economies, namely the BRICS nations: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. However, this demand continues to rise in the Arabic countries from which most of today’s highest quality oil comes from as well.</p>

    <p class="indent">As the push towards higher standards of livings comes from these countries, with a huge growing middle class in China and India that are looking towards owning their own vehicles, the demand in oil that is required to run that style of life climbs with it. Americans have gotten comfortable with the idea that oil will continue to steadily be shipped across the ocean from places like Saudi Arabia. What they fail to understand, or perhaps have not taken the time to think about, is that these nations will surely choose to supply their own citizens with their country’s riches first and foremost before they choose to supply foreign nations like the United States. Across the world, a trend that has been steadily increasing is that of nations nationalizing their oil and choosing to keep the profits created from their oil extraction within their borders and not on the other side of the world in the pockets of corporate entities. I believe this trend will by all means continue as the citizens of countries began to realize the gravity and reality of the global peaking in oil supply.</p>

    <p class="indent">Political institutions, as oppose to the citizens they ‘serve’, have been well aware of the concept of declining global oil production for decades. It has been proven through Freedom Of Information Access requests that shortly after ascending to the vice-presidency of the United States, Richard Cheney commissioned a top-secret think-tank to examine oil supplies and production across the world. Most of the attention we can see was directed towards Iraq, to the point where every oil well in Iraq was marked on a map with the corresponding amount of predicted oil supply remaining. It is little wonder that within a year’s time the United States, based on a precedent of provably false information, and fabricated links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, sent their military overseas to overthrow the Iraqi regime and occupy the country. Need I remind you that this military occupation continued for nearly a decade, from March of 2003 to December of 2011. I remember many people wondering and gesticulating back in the early 2000s that the primary reason the United States invaded Iraq was not in fact to fight a ‘war on terrorism’, nor for humanitarian reasons, but simply to secure for themselves the oil within that country.</p>

    <p class="indent">“Are they only invading because of the oil?” people would openly wonder. Well, the answer in short form is yes. However, there were other extremely interesting reasons that the Bush and his regime overthrew the sovereign regime of Iraq as well, which I will delve into briefly.</p>

    <p class="indent">Since the purpose of this book is to look specifically at exponential curves surrounding resource depletion, debt accumulation and technological advancement, I will not dwell for long on the subject of out-of-control governments and their brutal blood-for-oil foreign policy, but rather I will cover the topic long enough to indicate the major role oil has played in global geopolitics in the last decade. With that being said, let’s examine a bit more deeply the circumstances surrounding the United States invasion of Iraq and see if there are more clues that we can find that will allow us to arrive with even greater certainty at the idea that “yes, oil supply has in fact been one of, if not the foremost driving factor in geopolitics in the last decade”.</p>

    <p class="indent">By the end of this book, if my mission has been fulfilled and the book has been written properly, you will be able to from the point of having given this book a thorough read, easily dissect headlines and see much deeper into the story than the parcel of fabricated reality that the mainstream media will allow you to consider. What you begin to see before too long is that all of these topics are extremely interconnected and that it is truly impossible to draw a distinction between American foreign policy, dwindling oil supplies, shrinking economies and extreme ballooning debts in the world. All of these things feed closely upon eachother, and with that in mind, let’s look deeper at the circumstances surrounding the invasion of Iraq, and some other things that appear highly suspicious even to those who have little understanding of the nature of highly militaristic states such as the United States of America.</p>

    <p class="indent">As it currently stands, all the oil priced in the world is priced in American dollars. That means that if you want to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia, the only currency that they will accept is only the American dollar. This system harkens all the way back to the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944 which decided the American dollar would be the world reserve currency. Even still today, this pricing of the world’s oil in terms of American dollars is extremely beneficial to America. What it means is that when China buys oil from Iran, the American Federal Reserve gets a slice of the pie. It also means that when the American dollar begins to spiral out of control, and the dollar begins losing its value at an alarming rate, those countries who price their oil in dollars get less value in return. Like I said, this pricing of oil in American dollars has been the norm since the Bretton Woods agreement was created in the 1940s, however in early 2000s something very peculiar happened.</p>

    <p class="indent">Despite having been a former ally of America, and despite the wishes of America, Saddam Hussein was not a puppet of the US. As opposed to someone who could quite easily be observed to be an American puppet, such as Hosni Mubarak was in Egypt, Hussein could not be intimidated or bullied by the United States. As ex cia-asset John Perkins describes in his book ‘Confessions Of An Economic Hitman’, Saddam Hussein had also been trained by the CIA and thus knew their methods well. This ultimately made it impossible for the United States to simply assassinate Hussein, as has been their historical choice for South American leaders who have not chosen to play ball with the American corporatocracy.</p>

    <p class="indent">Hussein ultimately saw through the trick of the being forced to price his nation’s oil in American dollars. He thus began to price his oil in Euros, a move that was unprecedented at the time and certainly drew the ire of Washington. However, this move was economically very ingenius and in a very short amount of time Hussein, the only leader pricing his nation’s oil in something other than American dollars, quickly grew his oil profits by 12%. It should also be recognized that this oil was nationalized, as oppose to privatized, so the money went directly to the state and not into the coffers of international corporations. I should mention here that I am in no way trying to validate Hussein’s human rights record, or vindicate him personally from his brutal history surrounding civil rights. I am merely painting the stage for what ultimately became his downfall, the events that led up to his eventual being overthrown by the United States.</p>

    <p class="indent">As Iraq priced its oil in Euros and began to rake in huge profits, the world’s attention was drawn. The United States had to send a huge message, and they did exactly that. After what we know now was <em>complete</em> and <em>purposeful</em> misinformation fabricated out of thin air by American intelligence, connecting Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda and claiming as Rumsfeld put it regarding Iraq’s ‘Weapons Of Mass Destruction’,”We know where they are”. Dick Cheney was also not mincing any words, saying on record “There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction”.</p>

    <p class="indent">The amount of trickery and deception employed by that regime has been, in retrospect, absolutely staggering. We know now that Cheney was leaking, ‘anonymously’, false intelligence reports about Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction to the New York Times. He would then have the audacity to go on television, making the rounds to the mainstream networks, and with a straight face would tell the cameras and the people of the world that “we have seen now a report coming out of the New York Times saying that Saddam Hussein has consistently tried to acquire aluminium tubes specifically designed to enrich uranium. <em>Now I don’t want to take credit for this myself, I want to attribute this to The Times</em>”. (It is also of interest to note that both George Bush and Dick Cheney testified to the 9/11 Commission <em>together, behind closed doors, off the record and not under oath.</em> But that is a story for the next book.</p>

    <p class="indent">With the misinformation (blatant lies) planted in the mind of the world, and under the auspices of fighting a ‘war on terror’ the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. Shortly after removing the regime, Halliburton, which Cheney helmed as the CEO two years before taking office, then signed lucrative contracts to develop refineries for all the seized oil and began pumping it. All the oil wells were privatized and put in the hands of American and British corporations.</p>

    <p class="indent">Although now many people believe that the US is out of Iraq since its removal of ‘military personnel’, the fact of the nature is that the United States will never leave Iraq. Little known is that upon takeover of the country, the United States began to assemble permanent military bases and create an ‘embassy’ which cost over $1 billion dollars and is larger than the size of Vatican City. This is not something that is done on a temporary basis, with the idea that you will come, “spread democracy”, and then leave after you have finished “liberating” the people. This is something that is done strategically with the long term in mind, and indeed that is exactly what the American empire has chosen to do.</p>

    <p class="indent">The Iraq war by now is an obvious scenario since we have been able to, in the decade following its inception, look at the trail of evidence and give it an examination that would not be possible during the time at which it was undertaken. But can we see any similar events taking place today that would indicate that America is still in the game, using military force to secure oil resources across the world? The answer is an emphatic: yes. These are truths that will receive little to no airplay in the corporate controlled media, but when you begin to examine recent events, looking for clues of a resource-motivated intervention in a country, it is not difficult to see many flying examples. Two in particular are Libya and Afghanistan.</p>

    <p class="indent">Without digging to deeply into these topics and turning this book into an examination of geopolitics, we can see what the intentions of NATO were when they became involved in these two countries. Libya as a nation fit the model perfectly: it was a nation whose oil was nationalized and owned by the people, with a leader who was an outspoken critic of the United States, and whose oil reserves housed some of the finest quality crude in the entire world. Additionally, Gaddafi was in the process of creating a gold-backed currency called the Dinar, which would be used for trading for oil. Of course, the only narrative that most people received was that this was NATO answering the humanitarian call and saving the Libyan people from their own government, but by now I think most people are beginning to understand that the term ‘humanitarian’ is one of the most commonly abused terms ever to be employed by imperial powers. Saddam Hussein certainly had cracked down and taken the lives of his own citizens, an implorable act undoubtedly, but he also certainly never murdered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens, which is where the death toll now lies today<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft15" id="fn15"><sup class="frac">15</sup></a>—that could only be done by an occupying military force.</p>

    <p class="indent">In Afghanistan, a war which is ongoing and has continued now for over a decade, the most recent date supplied for exit has been 2014. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, this is also when the creation of a huge multi-country pipeline will be completed, leaving those with a healthy dose of scepticism to speculate that the pipeline, and a foothold in the oil-rich Middle East is what the military industrial complex is seeking in Afghanistan, as oppose to ‘liberating’ the people who live there.</p>

    <p class="indent">Libya has been the latest country to face a regime change at the hand of the United States, but they certainly are not the last on the chopping block. As I write this there is a huge push by the usual Anglo-American suspects in creating the conditions for an invasion of both Syria and Iran. It will be difficult to judge whether full-blown overt invasion occurs, or draw any firm conclusion on what will happen in these turbulent times, but it is not difficult to see that America is continuing to try and increase its presence in the Middle East. As trends analyst Gerald Celente has wondered “do you think America would have invaded Iraq if its main export was broccoli?”</p>

    <p class="indent">Political leaders have not been the only type of people well aware of the circumstances surrounding depleting oil supplies. Geologists working for oil companies and indeed much of the scientific community which deals with oil have been astutely aware of the situation we have been heading towards for decades. Even Scientific America has reported as early as March 1998 saying that “using several different techniques to estimate the current reserves of conventional oil and the amount still left to be discovered, we conclude that the decline will begin before 2010”.</p>

    <p class="indent">Then CEO of ARCO, an American oil company, in 1999 said quite bluntly that “we’ve embarked on the beginning of the last days of the age of oil”. Even Goldman Sachs, who perhaps in later books I will be able to in detail portray their malignant sleights of hand and deceptive siphoning of wealth, was forced to conclude in a 1999 report that “The oil companies are not going to keep rigs employed to drill dry holes. They know it but are unable … to admit it. The great merger mania is nothing more than a scaling down of a dying industry in recognition that 90% of global conventional oil has already been found”.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is also impossible for the White House administration of 2000-2008 to have not known about depleting oil resources considering during that administration the president George Bush, and the vice president Dick Cheney had both been at one point executives of major oil companies. Indeed, the CIA in 1995 was subscribed to a $35,000 annual report supplied by Petroconsultants, a Swiss company who in 1995 a report titled ‘The world’s oil supply’ predicted that during the first decade of the next century is when peak oil supply would be reached.</p>

    <p class="indent">The question is, why then if it is generally agreed upon that we are beginning to reach the end of a whole paradigm of economic and human growth based upon a once abundant but increasingly elusive resource, why is it that the general public has been made to be so unaware? Certainly, Obama has had to increasingly remark on oil prices as it has pushed consumers and businesses alike to the brink, but his remarks have always landed far from mentioning that we are simply running out of easily accessible and cheaply acquired supply. Have you ever heard a story about dwindling oil supplies receive play on a major network television? Perhaps you have, but I certainly have not. The latest love-life of the latest Kardashian is what is more commonly played across the major newspapers—the people are left without bearing in a world that is changing at an accelerating pace.</p>

    <p class="indent">Even yet, the story of oil depletion has an added twist to it. Beyond the land-wars we have seen fought to secure the last remaining strongholds of supply, there are deeper and more sinister factors coming into the fore. I have already explained the idea of energy-returned-for-energy-invested and the idea that we as a species have already plucked the ‘low hanging fruit’, that being the most easily accessed oil reserves. What this means for us is that beyond Hubbert’s bell curve which denotes supply, and is personified by a smooth, rolling descant, there is a much more pertinent chart which must be considered in the stead of Hubbert’s smoothly descending supply graph to give us the real picture of energy depletion.</p>

    <p class="indent">If the <em>quality</em> of oil and <em>accessibility</em> of oil remained constant as we embarked on our descent down the other side of the supply curve, we <em>would</em> be able to chart to consider that curve as accurately representing what we will be experiencing in the coming years. However, we know this not to be the case. What we can find by analyzing data is that in fact, <em>conventional (cheap) crude oil production has already long since peaked, occurring in 2004</em>. When we look at the descent of the oil supply, we <em>must</em> include the fact that the oil we are beginning to pump out in lower quantities, using more complicated (expensive) methods of extraction is in and of itself worse quality. This leaves us with what is called the ‘net-Hubbert curve’, a curve which factors in both decreases in quality of oil and increases in cost of extraction. What we are left with is a curve that unlike the smooth, gradual decline of the Hubbert curve, is personified by a much sharper drop. This means that instead of a gradual, smooth ascent of prices at the pump, prices to heat our home and prices to produce our food, what we are instead going to experience is a much more sudden increase that is far less relenting on the down side.</p>

    <p class="indent">Little does a better job of illustrating this better than just actually looking at the price of crude oil itself. There was once an era where gasoline was considered a dangerous hydrocarbon and was sold for 3 cents a gallon, an era where natural gas was burned off as a waste product. The price for a barrel of oil was as low as $1 a barrel in 1970 and as low as $6 a barrel in 1986. This can be juxtaposed with today’s price of $105.27, and the pre-2008 crash price of over $147 a barrel. As of my editing this section of the book the price of crude is $93.15.</p>

    <p class="indent">It may be interesting for yourself to look now at the price of gasoline and the price of crude oil-but do not jump to hasty conclusions before you read the section on economics and come to understand the phenomenon of deflation. The point is, for my parents, and certainly their parents, the time when oil would be over $100 a barrel probably seemed like a far-off if not impossible reality. The idea they would arrive at the day of reckoning for the age of oil and industrial society would probably seem like a crackpot idea, yet here it is now, breathing on our doorstep. Indeed, with the price of oil reaching such formerly inconceivable heights, the economic implications when considering our dependence on oil nearly seals the fate for our industrial society. Fewer people are being able to, in a stifled economy with a poor job market, afford the necessary cost of transportation by car. An article has come out in the Irish Times where a couple in Ireland having to only use one of their two cars, simply because they could not afford the gas to operate both.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="block">““Fuel is just taking a massive chunk out of our salaries. Even with one car, it’s becoming frightening to see how much money we put in every week.” – Kiera and Peter Lambe <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft16" id="fn16"><sup class="frac">16</sup></a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">They were also having to arrange their shifts so that they were able to both reach work in a single commute, and would have to do the same for the car-ride home. In days of $1 a barrel oil or $6 a barrel oil, the idea that in a generation people would have to simply leave their cars parked on their driveway because of their inability to afford to fuel it would probably seen unfathomable. Yet today it is a reality.</p>

    <p class="indent">We are unable to peer directly into the future and foresee what will transpire, but what we are able to do is look back at history and use that information to make a well-informed prediction of where we are headed. One scenario that will be particularly helpful for us in judging where we are headed is to look at the history of the United States and the pattern of their oil production. The United States has, along with the data to supplement it, already lived out their peak oil scenario. They have already seen their oil production, once the greatest in the world, grow to gargantuan heights and in the process afford their citizens the highest standards of living the world. From there we saw their economy grow in size of scope and magnitude all the way until 1970, where it met its ultimate peak of total oil production. From analyzing and studying the way the descent occurred and the effect it had on their people, we can apply these observations to the broader situation of global-peak oil production and draw some parallels between their situation, now in the past, and our global situation which we sit on the precipice of. Of course, the parallels will not be exact, but it will serve a great purpose as a guide for us to navigate. The full examination of this of course will be in the final part of the book where we try to piece this all together, but in the meantime we can give it a brief examination as a segue into the next section of the book.</p>

    <p class="indent">What we saw in the United States was oil discoveries peaking in the 1930s, and then a peaking of production which occurred 40 years later in the year of 1970. This pattern of peak production lagging peak discoveries by 40 years is recurrent and serves as a good measurement for us to apply to the rest of the world. However, it is rather harrowing when you look at the data and find that global oil discovery peaked in the 1960s, and has since been on a steady and current downfall for the last 47 years.</p>

    <p class="indent">Ultimately, this 40 year rule of thumb corresponds perfectly with our global peak production in terms of conventional oil, that is, easily accessible oil that is effortlessly pumped out of the ground. We have since been using more nonconventional methods, such as tar sands and off-shore drilling to fill the void. These things, as we have learned, have very poor energy returns, and thus, as we observe the patterns of conventional <em>discovery</em>, we can say with a great deal of certainty that the oil <em>production</em> will follow a similar pattern. (If you can believe it, oil companies will not drill where there has not been proven to be any oil, very unbelievable yes I know).</p>

    <p class="indent">Do not be confused by mainstream sources that tell us of hundred of million barrel discoveries will somehow patch up this very real problem in the global market. As Richard Heinberg has said in his book “The Party’s Over”, “Even if the guess of [ultimately recoverable barrels of oil] is off by two or three hundred billion barrels, the error will not affect the timing of the production peak by more than a few years”. The global demand for oil, that is, our global dependence on oil, is just too severe for small discoveries, or even somewhat large discoveries to patch over. Our material reality will not change around our patterns of consumption, behaviour and lifestyles—our patterns of consumption, behaviour and lifestyles will invariably change around our material reality.</p>
