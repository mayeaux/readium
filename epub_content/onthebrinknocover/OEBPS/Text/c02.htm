    <p class="indent">The UN estimates that there are more than seven billion unique people living on our planet right now, or to be shown as a number for better comprehension: 7,000,000,000. And it certainly wasn’t this way for the history of mankind. During our tenure as <em>homo sapiens</em>, mastering agriculture and moving across the world to become the dominant species on Earth, we grew in population at a mathematical snail’s pace. Or rather, in biological terms, we grew at a normal, linear and sustainable rate. Our population was capped off due to the environmental factors including limits to food and water, predation, death due to disease, and lack of shelter. Each one of these ensured that the population of our more primitive ancestors were kept at a limit more regularly seen by nature. Indeed, the average life expectancy as recently as the 1800s was only 40 years, whereas today it numbers closer to the mid 70s.</p>

    <p class="indent">Humans are truly marvels of nature. We have been able to collectively manipulate our surroundings and circumstances and in many ways circumvent the natural laws of the world of which we’ve been born into. We live in Arctic areas but sustain livable temperatures in our homes with the burning of natural gas. We use antibiotics to kill micro-bacteria that without technology we would never have known existed, and are thus able to elude the deathly grasp of disease in ways which our ancestors could simply not comprehend. We are able to perform medicinal miracles and increasingly now we are able to engineer biotechnologies and even create artificial limbs whose control is governed by the actual thoughts of the person who bears it.</p>

    <p class="indent">Needless to say, we are in some fundamental way unique in nature and different from the other species it has born. We don’t need to go deeply into the philosophies of what may or may not separate us from animals, but what we need to understand is that although we are very clever apes, and not swinging from trees like our closest relative the Chimpanzee, we are in no way removed from mother nature and her ability to snatch lives. We are still made out of human skin and flesh, rely on food sources for our energy to survive, are subject to emotional outbursts and are extremely, extremely fallible to those naturally occurring factors which can change the conditions of our environment from one conducive to maintaining survival, to one in which survival is very difficult. We don’t need to be reminded how easily we can truly be taken from the planet. Events like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy show how even in our ‘advanced, Westernized’ societies, when the social fabric is torn apart we become as we were in the beginning: apes struggling against the laws of nature to preserve our very own life. This is in no way meant to scare the reader, this is simply to demonstrate a point: that although we imagine ourselves to be very smart and always one step ahead of nature, and although in many ways we are, at the end of the day we ultimately must answer to the call of mother nature and reality. Now that we have broken down the delusion of humanity’s separation from the physical laws of energy and have realized that we are in fact ultimately subject to the laws of nature, let’s examine more deeply the biological terms that surround population growth.</p>

    <p class="indent">Two terms are crucial to be understood if we are to examine the ways in which populations grow and disappear. The first is ‘limiting factor’ and the second is ‘carrying capacity’. Both of these terms are easily explained and extremely crucial to be understood in our analysis of population.</p>

    <p class="indent">Firstly, a limiting factor is the condition that occurs in the environment that is the foremost limit in population growth. As I alluded to earlier, for our more prehistoric ancestors the limiting factor was simply energy deficiencies: a limit in acquiring energy from a finite amount of naturally obtainable food sources. If we are living in an environment in which we spend most of our time and energy foraging, scavenging or hunting, then certainly food is not abundant. In these conditions, child birthing and rearing is extremely burdensome and energy intensive. This places a very natural and firm restriction on population growth. However, a limiting factor need not be constrained to simply food sources. The limiting factor of any given environment is simply the most limited resource upon which life is dependent for survival. If the two things we needed to survive were bananas and water and we so happened to live in an environment abundant in bananas but limited in water, then our limiting factor would be the amount of water. The amount of bananas we have in surplus is irrelevant as the thing that restrains our growth will continue to be the amount of water we must necessarily obtain for survival. Thus, we grow until that naturally occurring limit is reached and at that point we can grow no further. We will examine in a few moments the uncanny ability humans have had in eluding our limiting factors, but first let’s look at the other term.</p>

    <p class="indent">The second term fundamental for our analysis is ‘carrying capacity’. This is the maximum amount of life that can be sustained by the energy available in the environment. To return to our former example, let’s imagine that there are 100 bananas in a jungle, and each of the ten apes living in this jungle requires ten bananas to survive. Therefore this population has already reached its carrying capacity. This signals that any more growth in terms of population will ultimately mean that someone will not survive and that a reduction in the population is unavoidable. The carrying capacity is therefore the maximum amount of population that can be sustained within a given environment based on a certain limiting factor. The crucial question therefore is whether or not we as humans have already reached our carrying capacity. However, this answer depends on what is chosen as the limiting factor. Is it an environmental threshold, a point at which environmental degradation has radically altered the conditions on which we survive to the point where are no longer able to support a population of seven billion? Is it energy limits, where we may cross an event horizon where a once abundant energy source used to maintain human survival will no longer be available to support our population? Or are there no foreseeable limiting factors, and humans will continue to grow at this truly exponential rate?</p>

    <p class="indent">Although firmly concluding that there is a known answer to this question is very foolhardy and even dangerous, what we can safely do is critically examine where we stand in the present day, and use our available information to piece together an understanding of the most powerful trends acting upon our world. Based on the data, we can create a model of the world centered on the interactions of these trends and use that model to make reasoned and cerebral assessments of the future. This is precisely what I have done in the final chapter, after we have gone over the data, evidence and theory behind the three major analyses contained in this book. To a certain degree, we have the power contained within ourselves to collectively ‘grab the steering wheel of change’ and decide our shared future and destiny (especially if we are made astutely aware of where we are currently headed). However, even collective action cannot outmaneuver some of the material and physical realities that will necessarily be faced. This is why it is of the utmost importance that the general public is well informed in these matters. With this in mind, let us continue the examination of population growth and its recent exponential explosion.</p>

    <p class="indent">If we were to take a look at a chart plotting population growth against time, you would be immediately forced to notice something very major and powerful. The human population grows on an almost steady, linear pace--save the Great Plague--until about the 1800s. Then we witness something extremely unprecedented and forceful occur. The population begins to explode upward at a trajectory which is no longer straight but is now curved. This particular curve nearly perfectly fits the plot of an exponential curve, which harbors extreme significance and serious implications.</p>

    <p class="indent">Understanding the nature of an exponential curve is absolutely critical in comprehending the power that lies within the trends not only surrounding population growth, but also debt accumulation and the rise of computer technology. Therefore, to aid in this understanding in an entertaining fashion that is not only fun for the entire family but extremely useful in our portrayal of what exponential growth really is, I will paraphrase an ancient Indian fable. The details of the story are usually switched around with each version you hear, like all fables, so I will make up my own Anthony-Mayfield version for the reader. It goes a little something like this:</p>

    <p class="indent">There was once a wise man who loved the game of chess. The people of his country were facing a huge economic down-turn and the crooked leader of his beloved country, Stephen Harper, had just raised the age for receiving pensions and made huge cuts to social programs as people across the country were feeling very real pain and anguish. This wise chess-lover had been a thorn in the side of Harper’s regime, around every turn trying to expose his corrupted and wretched ways. One day the Dear Leader, Harper, decided he could take no more of this young activist trying to topple his government, so he decided to challenge him to a game of chess. Harper declared that if he would win the game, the young activist would have to quit all his opposition to the government and would have to return to his role as a sedentary young man. The activist agreed, and when asked what he would like in return if he won the game he replied “a grain of wheat on the first checker of the chessboard, two grains of wheat on the second square on the chessboard, four grains of wheat for the third square on the chessboard and so on”.</p>

    <p class="indent">Harper, being his usual imbecilic self hastily agreed to the terms of the game. Well, sure enough, after Harper was checkmated very swiftly, the young activist received his prize. His government cronies came out with a bag of wheat and put a single piece on the first square, two on the second, four on the third and so on. (Okay, slamming Harper was fun enough, but this is where it gets very important, so pay attention. You might see where this is going but I can almost guarantee you don’t realize where it will end up). As they began to put the wheat on the board, they noticed something. 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. Soon they had to get another bag of wheat. 512, 1024, 2048, 4096. They began to bring in wheat on pallets. 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536,. Then in truckloads. 131072, 262144, 524288. Then Lear jets. 1,048576, 2,097,152, 4,194,304. Soon all the people in Canada were on their way to being well fed. The banking executives funding Harper began having to cut their executive bonuses just to be able to afford the wheat. 8,388,608. 16,777,216. 33,554,432…..</p>

    <p class="indent">I’m sure you can see where this is going, but again, can you see where it ends? Just take a second and try and think. Where will this growth finish? A billion grains of wheat? A trillion?</p>

    <p class="indent">With 64 squares on a chessboard, which seems innocuous enough, the final result is actually staggering. The final number is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Eighteen quintillion, four hundred and fourty six quadrillion, seven hundred and fourty-four trillion seventy three billion, seven hundred and nine million. A number that perhaps you being smarter than myself can comprehend, but I certainly cannot even fathom. The graph below shows exactly how powerful exponential growth can start to become over a long enough period.</p>

    <p class="indent">It would seem to be impossible, yet this is the number that we are left with. Now you can see why I began this section with the quote that I did. But please, although it is nearly impossible to visualize the number of eighteen quintillion, it is extremely possible to understand the power of exponential growth, and it’s going to be very important as this book is mostly a book about trends that are in fact acting in an exponential way. But before we move from the topic, let’s touch on a final little primer of the exponential equation. Mathematics isn’t the sexiest topic in the world, nor is it one of my personal favorites, and being that I want this book to be very easily understood and enjoyed, we will not be dwelling on geometric mathematics for long, so don’t worry! However, considering the absolute necessity of a good comprehension of this topic we will dig a bit deeper before we move on.</p>

    <p class="indent">A normal <strong>linear</strong> equation is one in which the rate of returns stay constant.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/21-1.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">If we imagine a graph that plots for example population against time, and we place a straight horizontal line across the graph we will see that the value of the population stays the exact same as we move through time. If we tilt that line up a bit, we see that there is now growth in population, but again growth which moves at a linear pace. In other words, <em>the pace of the growth of population stays exactly the same</em>. Now, if we were to take that flat line and shift it 45 degrees counter clockwise, we would see that the population is doubling only when the period of time elapsed doubles as well. In this example, one year there are four humans, the next year there are eight, the next year there are twelve and so on. The population is growing at a steady speed, and speed of the growth stays the same as well.</p>

    <p class="indent">Juxtapose that with <strong>exponential growth</strong>. The line is not straight, it is a curve.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/22-1.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">This is what makes exponential growth so powerful. The rate of return is not constant, but is in fact constantly accelerating. With each period of time elapsed, the growth builds upon itself to reach higher and higher, until the curve is pointing straight upwards. We will take a term from physics and call that moment at which the curve is shooting up at a virtually vertical angle as the singularity. Before we reach the point of singularity however, we must go through the curved part of the equation, which is called the ‘knee of the bend’. The line comes in at a nearly straight horizontal fashion and after passing through the knee of the bend ends in a nearly straight vertical fashion (meaning infinite and instant growth—a place where time no longer has any bearing).</p>

    <p class="indent">Indeed, the exponential equation has power that, as we’ve seen, is hardly fathomable to the human mind. But try your best to fathom it and try also to appreciate some of the implications that these exponential growths have on your life, considering you are smack-dab in the middle of a world riddled with them. The basis of this book is to examine three major trends which are in fact growing at an exponential speed, the repercussions of which are of world-shifting magnitudes.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now that you know how powerful an exponential equation is, we can imagine a few places in our life in which we might want some exponential equations. The size of our net worth may be one such instance! If our personal money supply was growing exponentially, we would not have to wait long to gain significant material wealth, even if we started with only a very small amount of initial cash. Perhaps you can think of a few others, but be careful. You might want to say your ability to lift weights at the gym--but think about that for a second. Benching 200 pounds may be an admirable goal, but what does someone who can bench 40,000 pounds look like? Indeed, the flip side to the enormous ability of the exponential equation is the danger it harbors. It can become somewhat frightening, especially when you realize that human population, debt growth and the power of computing technology are all progressing at exponential speeds.</p>

    <p class="indent">What we are left with is a world in flux, a world that in thirty years may look completely different from now, in another twenty five years it may again look completely different again and in another twenty years it may undergo yet again another major transformation. Given the volatility of the world and the literally infinite complexity of the world, it is impossible and certainly foolish to suspect to know the dates when these shifts will take place or, to firmly attest to know what these shifts will create, but the important thing is not knowing when they will be triggered and what they will create, but instead to know that they are coming (which is a recurring theme throughout this book).</p>

    <p class="indent">If the implications of these exponential growth equations in population, debt and computing technology weren’t severe enough, there are also trends which are stuck in the middle of an exponential curve but in a different manner. Inversely to the population, the amount of usable resources on the planet is declining in the same manner—exponentially. When you see petroleum companies paying billions of dollars to create offshore platforms and pump oil out from below the ocean floor, or melt oil from sand like in the tar sands, it is not difficult to surmise that easily accessible oil is running out. Some might project that we will even at one point run out of oil to be obtained from the Earth. However, the situations surrounding the amount of oil we can extract from the Earth is a bit more complex than just one day realizing “oops—we’ve ran out”.</p>

    <p class="indent">It may seem counter-intuitive, but we will end using oil much sooner than we will run out of total supply of oil. As will be demonstrated in the following pages, or will be demonstrated each time you fill up at the gas pump, the labor cost of getting hydrocarbons into your vehicle will be increasing quicker than the speed at which we are running out of supply of oil. Upcoming in the following pages is a thorough explanation of why that is, but just as a teaser consider this: What costs more, sticking a drill into some dirt in Texas and extracting thousands of barrels a day from a large underground reservoir, or creating a machine that can float hundreds of kilometers off the coast-line and drill thousands of feet below the ocean floor to extract of oil to be transported back to the shore? Just like the fable with the wheat, it is easy to anticipate and observe the trend—but it is another thing entirely to try and contemplate where that trend will take us. Specifically, that is what the last section of this book will attempt to do.</p>

    <p class="indent">The second thing to examine is debt. Debt is a bit of a misnomer. People as a whole don’t really understand debt, credit, or much to do with finance in general. However, to understand the economic situation we are in today, it is absolutely critical to have a good degree of knowledge of the force that will ultimately speed the collapse of our economy, which is in fact the amount of debt in the world. I am especially looking forward to explaining the economics behind this because when I was digging deep into this topic I found some absolutely startling truths about the state of our economic system--realizations that will send shivers down your spine. This is another topic that is so important for everyone and Canadians in particular to understand. It is filed under the ‘how the hell does no one know about this and why the hell doesn’t the corporate media ever talk about this’ category. Therefore I am extremely thankful that you are reading this and can receive the information that will be presented within this book and that section. What you will find is that these concepts of resources, oil, and economics are all intrinsically linked to a point of nearly being inseparable. Indeed, the Canadian currency, the cash you have right now in your wallet is commonly referred to as a ‘petro-dollar’, meaning a currency whose value fluctuates in unison with the value of oil.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another thing that is extremely pertinent, and is, after all the dust settles, actually the Achilles heel of our whole economic system is the idea of infinite growth. This is where resources and economics intersect and come to a head perfectly. One of the many signals that our economic system is certain to crash is the fact that it is reliant on infinite and ever-lasting, perpetual <em>exponential</em> growth. That’s right, if this economy does not grow infinitely and in an exponential fashion, the whole thing comes screeching to an ugly halt. We all know that politicians like to speak about growth: ‘Growth this, growth that, we need to keep interest rates low to spur growth’, etcetera. Well, the truth is that the economic outlook in terms of growth for 2013 and 2014 in Canada has been poor since its inception, with economists since 2012 continuing to make their ‘growth’ predictions—1%,2%,3%,4%. What people like you and I don’t realize, or aren’t supposed to realize, is that ‘growth’ is actually an exponential equation in disguise. It’s just like the idea of compound interest. The growth happens at a rate of, let’s say 3%. That 3% remains constant, but the initial amount that has to been grown has increased since the last year. That 3% means a larger amount growth than the year before, the next year that 3% will mean an even larger necessary growth. Indeed, growing at a constant rate of 3% means an entire doubling of the size of the entire economy in only 23 years.</p>

    <p class="indent">Is this sustainable, especially given our limited natural resources and increasing rate of environmental degradation? Is it reasonable to conclude that in our world of finite and diminishing resources, where the industrial era has already wreaked great havoc on the ecosphere and conditions on which our species requires for survival, that we will be able to grow our economy in scope and magnitude infinitely and at an exponential rate? Well, it would be asinine to throw out a conclusion without the necessary background evidence, so hold onto your thoughts and we will reach that discussion in the third chapter. Make sure to also grab your popcorn, because I promise that chapter will be absolutely over the top. It really is an Earth-shattering moment when you realize the whole ‘financial system’ that so many people in dapper suits speak so eloquently about is just a glorified pyramid scheme, one which is mathematically certain to end and leave whoever is left holding the ‘hot potato’ of debt in a world of pain and anguish. Out of all the information that could reasonably save someone’s life in this book, the most pragmatic solutions will be borne out of an understanding of the economic system and the knowledge of how to move yourself out from under the economic tsunami which has been growing in size and strength steadily since 2007.</p>

    <p class="indent">The final trend examined is an overlooked but undeniably powerful exponential trend which is the truly exponential rise in raw power of computing technologies. This will not be particularly difficult for most young people of today to understand and realize. It is not hard to see that something extremely powerful is occurring in the present day, when the phone I paid several hundred dollars for in 2011 has an 1080x720P HD camera, can seamlessly stream video from anywhere in the city, and in terms of computing power is thousands of times more powerful than the several-room sized computer located at MIT in the 1970s (and can fit into my pocket). Once we actually get into looking into the numbers surrounding this phenomenon, you will undoubtedly begin to see the world in a different way. Even as the author of this book, conducting the research for an uncountable amount of time and working and reworking that section, to simply read and familiarize myself again with the milestones this trend is passing still blows me away and makes my heart race—it really is that powerful.</p>

    <p class="indent">It will also not be difficult, or at least as difficult as it would be four or five years ago when I first learned about the exponential growth of computing technology, to describe to people what some of the more ‘futurist’ implications of this trend is. Mechanical exo-skeleton suits, metallic limbs that are directed by thoughts alone, artificial intelligence which cannot be distinguished from a human—these were once the subject of science fiction and speculation but are now assuredly real. Even the three things that I have just mentioned are already present in 2013 (even the part about artificial intelligence). But where does this fit in context with the other trends we are looking at, more importantly the crash and burn of our financial system and the depletion of the world’s natural resources? Do boundless amounts of computer technology have the ability to deliver us into a new type of Utopia? There is a lot of data, evidence, research and theory for us to dig into and explore which will drastically set you as the reader apart from most of the population who subscribes to the corporate media and is left completely in the dark. In the final chapter I will draw from what will be the well explained and articulated topics of oil depletion, debt accumulation and Supertechnology to draw a picture of how I see the next ten years unfolding.</p>

    <p class="indent">With this information, it allows us to examine these major trends which are taking place in the present moment and begin to position ourselves. I will share with you certain conclusions I have reached in the final chapter of the book, which are of course based on my own understanding of the world, my own experiences and my own research. The purpose in writing this book is primarily to lay out all the evidence and data in a well organized and coherent manner so that by the end of the book you are able to piece together the information autonomously and decide for yourself what you think the future may come to look like. At that point, it is up to you yourself to begin to organize your life and choose how you want to prepare for the future which will, certainly and inevitably, look drastically different than the present day.</p>

    <p class="indent">Without further ado, let’s get this started.</p>
