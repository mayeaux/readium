    <h1 class="chapter">VI<br />
    The Future</h1>

    <p class="indent">The writing of the first four chapters of this book was an attempt to explain four crucial concepts that are absolutely vital to understanding the course of the future, these of course being the nature of the exponential curve, trends surrounding resource depletions in oil (i.e. peak oil), dissolutions of fiat currencies and the inevitable crashing of our monetary system. Also included was analysis of the exponentially growing power of computer technology.</p>

    <p class="indent">In these chapters I have examined each phenomenon in isolation and tried my best to not put forth many projections on where I felt each phenomenon was headed and the way in which it would be experienced most. My purpose in restraining myself from making predictions in these chapters was to allow a read that upon completion would give the reader them self the ability to draw their own conclusions about where they thought the future was headed and they would have the academic foundation to do so. Or, if they felt that the analysis was commendable but insufficient (which it is—one book can hardly dig into these topics as deeply as is warranted by their importance) at least they would have received a good introduction and possess a first intellectual stepping stone from which they could start their own, personal journey into understanding these trends.</p>

    <p class="indent">Although the purpose in writing this was to grant the academic footing, based on evidence and research, that would allow readers to construct their own models of reality and the future, it is certain that I am not without my own feelings of where we are headed. Of course, examining and breaking down each of these concepts in isolation is a proper way to conduct an analysis on each specific topic, the fact of the matter is that these factors do <em>not</em> act in isolation of each other and are in fact intrinsically intertwined in a much larger system that draws upon many other topics and trends that could not be fit into a book of any length.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, although we cannot calculate projections of the future by adjusting for each variable (which we will discuss further in a moment), we can draw upon some of the largest macro-factors, namely those discussed in this book, to try and draw a wider scoping view of where we are collectively headed. Of course we cannot predict each micro-event that will spur along some of these larger, macroscopic trends but the developments that they are a part of; the larger, broader picture, we are certainly warranted to draw hypotheses of, based on evidence and historical precedents.</p>

    <p class="indent">For example, based on historical precedents and some budding modern trends, we can say with confidence that during times of economic collapse and upheaval, there is usually associated political upheaval and large fluctuations in the concurrent political scene. When people are living in destitution, fear and anger (along with hopelessness) ugly feelings of hatred and intolerance that were long perfumed under the scent of economic stability begin to quickly rise to the fore.</p>

    <p class="indent">When this happens, it is not difficult (and indeed is a tactic) for those seeking political power to scapegoat a certain segment of the society as the reason why the collapse has occurred. With this, deeply fascist far-right extremism and proto-Nazism resurgences have the capability of gaining substantial political clout. Therefore we can say, although we cannot predict the moments and the manners in which it will take place, that a resurgence of the extreme right and racist, proto-fascist movements taking place throughout these economically strangled countries is a macro-factor that will likely have a large play in the coming future. (This is a topic that will be visited in more depth, in this instance we are simply using it as an example—and I should mention also that this trend has already begun a long time ago and is quite developed at this point.)</p>

    <p class="indent">Another thing that I will mention before I begin to try and piece these trends together in an outlook for the future is that in trying to ‘predict’ the future, what is needed is a general model of how literally <em>everything</em> interacts and behaves. In an attempt to do this, we must create a model that interprets a very dynamic and constantly changing system (the world), and then, using a <em>limited</em> amount of information, try and draw a conclusion about where this dynamic model, built on an <em>infinite</em> amounts of variables and data is headed. The only problem with such an action is that it is both physically and mathematically impossible.</p>

    <p class="indent">This was proven by the work of a 19<sup class="frac">th</sup> century French mathematician, Henri Poincaré, and his work on the proof of the existence of chaos. As explained by professor Steve Keen, “Poincaré showed that not only was it impossible to derive a formula which could predict the future of a dynamic model with three or more elements to it, but even any numerical approximation to this system would rapidly lose accuracy. The future could be predicted only if the present was known to infinite accuracy, and this was clearly impossible”. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft37" id="fn37"><sup class="frac">37</sup></a></p>

    <p class="indent">For example, in physics it would be completely possible to predict the gravitational trajectory and relationship of two planets to one another, and calculations could be made in this regard that would accurately predict the movements of these planets. However, as soon as a third planet is introduced the chaos that would then play into the system makes it literally mathematically impossible (in our finite world) to surmise the relationship of the planets’ movements in the future.</p>

    <p class="indent">What Keen alludes to when he says “a numerical approximation would rapidly lose accuracy” is that even if, based on a <em>nearly infinite</em> amount of information, you could come up with a calculation that <em>nearly</em> calculates the trajectory and relationship of these planets, it would face an exponential growth in inaccuracy. As University of Maryland professor Edward Ott has put it “the exponential sensitivity of chaotic solutions means that, as time goes on, small errors in the solution can grow very rapidly <em>(ie exponentially).</em> Hence, after some time, effects such as noise and computer roundoff can totally change the solution from what it would be in absence of these effects”.</p>

    <p class="indent">Basically, any small initial error is going to be amplified over and over in an exponential fashion until the end result of your calculation (prediction) is something that is far removed from reality (picture the most dysfunctional game of ‘telephone’ ever imagined, perhaps with a million muttering people all with bad hearing—even if the first words are said loud and true, by the time it gets back to you the message received is going to be completely different than that originally sent).</p>

    <p class="indent">Thus, it is literally impossible to smack a seal on a complex system with ‘accurately predicted where this is headed’ proudly proclaimed. If anyone tells you that they have calculated exactly where the world is headed, pull out this book and tell them to get their read on. However, it is not to say that the model that I have created based on my own research is going to be wildly inaccurate in predicting outcomes of the future. Contrary to this, the projections I am going to make in the chapter will seem to be able to summarize the gist of where we are headed with almost clairvoyant accuracy. Do not get me wrong, I am far from a clairvoyant, I am merely reporting on very large trends that have already begun long ago and are almost certainly guaranteed to continue. Someone’s model of how reality works which references ‘Kim Kardashian’ more times than it does ‘peak oil’ will certainly be startled when stories that are based on the trend of reduced energy returned on energy invested begin to appear in the news and consciousness of the mainstream—this sense of being intimidated and frightened is exactly what this book is trying to deter.</p>

    <p class="indent">Rather than being startled by the stories about oil that have been coming out of the mainstream however, I have been startled by the accuracy of the model I have ‘created’ by plugging together some of these major trends that we have already covered. I have put ‘created’ in quotations because I have only created this model insofar as I have learned and considered the evidence of many academics and scholars, and simply tried to fashion all their ideas in onto one common work, connected to the theme of the exponential equation.</p>

    <p class="indent">As it was mentioned before, to predict perfectly a complex, dynamic model such as that of the reality we live within, you would need literally <em>infinite details and information</em> about the initial conditions of that system. Obviously, there are extreme finite limitations to this book: the amount of words are finite, the amount of time the author has had to study these topics is also finite, the amount of time the author has had to write is finite, and the amount of time the author has had to think about these topics is finite.</p>

    <p class="indent">We each have only a finite amount of everything, but what has allowed me the intellectual footing to write this book is that I have sacrificed many factors that the typical person partakes in to allow myself a larger chunk of this finite time to study, research and ultimately piece together and write about these topics (more on that towards the end of the book though). This book does not contend to be the ‘guide to exactly how the future will take place’, but if you have read the initial chapters then I think you can agree that there are some trends headed our way that are inescapable and absolutely Earth-shifting. This is the story of how I see those trends interacting in an outlook of the future.</p>

    <p class="indent">The reason why many of these trends will never be picked up by someone who doesn’t peer deeply into these topics is because of some nice hardwiring of the ol’ human brain, this time in the form of normalcy bias. Normalcy bias is based on the idea that people generally make their predictions of how the future is going to play out based on how the immediate past has played out. If there has been a ten year generally upbeat economic trend, then people who do not study economics or peek inside any amount of data will nearly certainly come to the conclusion that “the next ten years will be a generally upbeat economic decade”. This is hardly the fault of the person themself, who is perhaps ignorant but certainly not foolish per se; they are just doing do what their mind is good at, which is making models of the future based on the past. Just like people have a poor intuitive grasp of how exponential growth works (which Albert Bartlett has already put forth as the greatest shortcoming of man), people have also a poor intuitive grasp of the idea that “the future doesn’t always look like the past”.</p>

    <p class="indent">Of course, for readers of this book we understand that the idea that “the future doesn’t always look like the past” has special clout, considering that we understand the exponential slowing down of time that is occurring, which is manifesting in a huge, monumental and exponential shift the likes of which has never been seen before in human history or the universe. But again, juxtaposed with someone who creates their model of reality from watching “reality television” like American Idol—they will live their life based on models constructed from information that is completely irrelevant garbage and oftentimes completely manufactured and untrue.</p>

    <p class="indent">As mentioned before, the only news that people will ever receive through the medium of the mainstream is “pointless information or purposeful misinformation”. Those who subscribe to the mainstream will never be explained to what an exponential curve is, why it is so important and relevant to the problems that face humanity, and will thus never be able to model their idea of the future based on that. They are living in a sea of normalcy bias, a collectively held false belief that the world isn’t changing much, maybe besides the panel of judges on their favorite distraction show. Behind the scenes, away from their focus, the world is changing in ways that we already know are based on an exponential curve that grows more ruthless by the second. This, multiplied by the nearly infinite amount of chaos that is going to be introduced to this system via the major trends we have already examined, is a near 100% guarantee that the future will in fact <em>not</em> look like the past.</p>

    <p class="indent">The other thing that must be mentioned, in a similar vein to normalcy bias, is the nature of how people go about constructing their models of reality. The extremely hard limit that most people face in their development of reality is information. If we look at the mind in the sense of a computer: it can only make calculations and adjustments based on the information that it receives. People’s entire lives are based on models that they arranged using the information they have taken in over the course of their life.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is not hard to understand, but the important thing that must be considered is that this means <em>people cannot construct a model of reality outside of the information they receive</em>. The masses at large cannot spontaneously come up with the theory of peak oil, the data behind it, and then adjust their view of the world based on this divine impromptu realization. Instead, people pick up Cosmopolitan and construct their model of reality (which dictates behaviour) based on the ‘information’ inside of the magazine.</p>

    <p class="indent">What we are left with is instead of a well educated citizenry, whose models of reality are based on real and provable trends that are shaping the world, which could probably be signaled by the behaviour of shrewd, intelligent dialogues about how each person is preparing themselves with prudent actions, instead we have a citizenry of people purchasing new clothes for their dog because last year’s colors are out of fashion (and I kid you not, this is far from a made up example but instead handpicked from the mainstream). Thus, when you walk down the street you see people minding their own business, with their mind caught up in trying to remember all the inside scoops and ‘tips’ Cosmopolitan has laid on them, while walking their dog dressed in plaid shirts this year instead of striped.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is a symptom of a citizenry and population starved for relevant and important information, and basing their models of reality and behaviour on absolute trash. When these macro factors we have identified and examined in the book really begin to take off, the ‘tips’ learned in Cosmopolitan are the last thing that is going to be able to save people from a live of destitution and poverty. It will not help them navigate what may be the most turbulent times ever seen in the course of history. And ultimately, if too many people, too large of a percentage of the population are caught up in this and are unable to steer to safety, away from desperation and impoverishment, then we are collectively setting ourselves up for some very ugly developments, which will be the last topic I touch on at the very end of the book.</p>

    <p class="indent">Consider the scapegoating and proto-fascism that rises out of the ultra-right when too many people are desperate. This is only the proverbial ‘tip of the iceberg’, a small cross-section of the ills that can fall over a society that is too despairing to think clearly, whose fuse can be so easily ignited with hatred, rage and ignorance.</p>

    <p class="indent">Even if it is too fantastic of an idea to believe that this book could singlehandedly tip the scale between a society of plaid-shirt-wearing-dog walkers turned racist hate-mongers and a society of enlightened, rationally thinking and planning citizens riding out a wave of turbulence, then at the very least my friends and family, and your friends and family can posses the information that will allow them to make decisions that can allow them to live in comfort and happiness. If models of reality are based on the information available, then this book contains a sizeable amount of information which can be used to create behaviour able to save and protect, rather than create a society vulnerable to collapse and manipulation.</p>

    <p class="indent">Ultimately, the way I would summarize succinctly the inevitable changes coming would be to say firstly, the end of the world <em>as we know it</em> is not a synonym for the end of the world, and secondly that the upcoming ten years will be extremely unlike the last ten years. The theme of the upcoming decade will certainly be change, and although that change will be drastic and dramatic, it does not <em>necessarily</em> have to be painful and difficult.</p>

    <p class="indent">Again, like was mentioned before, the difficulty with which people move through this upcoming decade (just to make it a nice round 10 years) will certainly be based upon the model of reality that they are running. Unfortunately, if you are running Debt-Based Consumerism v2.0, you will be left in a very precarious situation. Survival is not guaranteed for all, and I say this as an academic trying to ascertain and deliver the truth, not as a doomsday prophet trying to stir up grief and havoc.</p>

    <p class="indent">We will examine and analyze the underlying reasons as to why I ultimately believe that evidence and data alone guarantees that those who are not taking the time to familiarize themselves with important concepts will face a very harsh landing. This will not be difficult for you the reader to understand, considering the topics and wealth of evidence already explored in this book, but if we can imagine someone who is currently caught in a web of debt, continuing to take on further debt, with a large exposure to a decrease in housing prices, living with the belief that the next ten years will run smoothly and without substantive change, then that person is residing in a very precarious situation.</p>

    <p class="indent">Explaining to them that the next ten years will not be that of stability and security but of instability, collapses, revolutions and reconstructions of society is of the utmost importance if, as we should, wish for our compatriots to survive. Those who believe there must not be much going on considering the top news story of the day was a bear in a garbage dumpster, and that the set of American Idol looks so intransient and indestructible, so real and stable—then they will either have a much deeper and harsher wake up call at some point in the future, or will have to depart deeper into a world of illusion and fantasy, further away from reality. We will also examine the split that is occurring in already collapsing societies, where those who live in a reality-television constructed, Fox-news manipulated model of the world will continue to be separated by an ever growing chasm between those subscribed to the corporate mainstream as opposed to those who acquire their information from independent news sources who provide accurate reporting on the transforming world.</p>

    <p class="indent">For Canadians, especially those who live their day to day within a model of reality which rarely stretches beyond their city limits (as I know to be the case with many of us), it will seem either alarmist or impossible to suggest that some of these things which I will describe that are already taking place in major cities across the world will finally come to roost in Canada. I have spoken already about the pervasive psychology that Canadians hold, naively believing Canada itself is ‘special’ and somehow autonomous and separate from the economic woes of the world. This of course must be maintained with a true ignorance of how our modern day so-called capitalism works with its complete embrace of ‘globalization’, through free-trade agreements such as NAFTA. These free-trade agreements are actually in fact more sinister than even the description given to them by academic Chris Hedges, who describes them as a “complete selling out of the middle and working class”, but why we cannot dig deeper into the issue will be explained at the conclusion of this chapter.</p>

    <p class="indent">The fact of the matter is that today every modern ‘Westernized’, ‘developed’ economy is essentially completely intertwined with the others, which took place under the doctrine of ‘globalization’ and goes by the name of ‘economic integration’. Ironically, this ideology, which foolishly (or perhaps insidiously) preaches that integration of economies is the key to economic stability and security, when it is found that in fact quite the opposite has taken place in areas that have embraced this integration, yet these same forces will purport the need for yet further meshing to take place as the solution to the problem.</p>

    <p class="indent">For example, look at the Eurozone. The integration of these economies and the introduction of a common currency has slowly dragged many countries into what can only be described as yet another Great Depression (which is a term recently used by the Greek Prime Minister). The worst is yet to come, of course, as we are still deep in the ‘extend and pretend’ phase, or as economist Graham Summers has more accurately described the ‘lie and deny’ phase.</p>

    <p class="indent">The real hard problem of countries having to ultimately leave the Euro or choose to cede their political sovereignty has yet to be dealt with. In the meantime, wholly insolvent countries are bailing out other wholly insolvent countries, something that is completely nonsensical and ultimately, even in the short term, very unsustainable. This economic integration as it were is what allowed the housing crash of the United States to drag banks throughout the world underwater. Completely toxic mortgage-backed securities were sold to banks all around the world, and when they turned sour (were found out to be less than worthless), there was a crash whose impact was felt within every economy on Earth.</p>

    <p class="indent">The fact is that these insolvent banks located across the world all owe each other nearly incomprehensible amounts of money, as an unimaginable amount of IOUs are floating around the world, with the very adhesive of trust which holds this leaking sieve together deteriorating at a rapid rate. This can spell extremely bad news, as what it ultimately describes is the inevitable crash of the entire financial system (something we have already examined in great detail). However, this can offer a grand window of opportunity to those who are able to be ahead of the curve, who can accurately foretell the collapse and beat the herd to the punch, protecting their accumulated wealth and even multiplying it by a possible several factors. Just like understanding trends about oil can allow someone to forego purchasing a sub 15 MPG unneeded truck, and opting for a more fuel efficient or even an electric car, can in the future insulate someone from a great deal of economic anguish, understanding trends of economic collapse can allow someone to also make decisions which in the future they will look back at with pride and joy, not regret and despair.</p>

    <p class="indent">Therefore, as the whole of this book has been to impart facts and knowledge that will allow people to understand and make productive decisions in this sea of change, this section will deal more specifically and explicitly with actions that I believe will allow someone to stay ahead of the curve and feel safe and secure despite the uncertainty that will be faced. There is a quote that goes ‘you can ignore reality, but you cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality’, and with that in mind, we will do our best to confront reality as best as possible and therefore plan for consequences of our actions that bring us to a more positive and hopeful place rather than a more negative and desperate place.</p>

    <p class="indent">Again, none of these issues and trends that we have covered occur in a vacuum or are separate from each other. Indeed, they all draw upon and interact with one another, so in this chapter I will do my best to, when at all possible, describe how these trends build and feed off of each other. Luckily, these factors have been in full gear for at least two years now, so the major trends which I will describe are already budding, and describing them will be more of an observation than a premonition. Of course, I am not claiming that these will all come true exactly as I will predict, as I have demonstrated earlier in this section, it is literally impossible to predict the churning and movements of a complex system such as the reality we live within. With that being said, the model I have constructed has been extremely accurate in predicting many major events. Most news that comes out seems to reinforce the movement of our reality to the model I have constructed, so although this chapter of course will not be perfect, I have very good faith in all of the concepts I will share. Also, for the sake of the reader, I have organized these ideas in order from those occurring in the short term to those occurring in the long term in what amounts to a chronological order of the future. With that being said, this is how I see personally the next ten years transpiring.</p>

    <p class="indent">The most immediate issue that Canadians will face is the debt crisis turned catastrophe that is currently sitting on our collective doorstep. At a current <span class="strike"><em>152</em></span> <span class="strike">154</span> 164.7% (all-time record) level of debt to income, and a personal, household debt that is collectively 92% of GDP, the major Achilles heel of Canadians is certainly the insane leverage they have taken on over the years. This could be argued to be due to desires of a lavish life, and the argument could be made that it was greed that has driven Canadians to dig themselves into such a hole, but that is certainly only part of the story. Since real wages have stagnated and declined since the 1970s, a gap has emerged in income and cost of living; a gap which has foolishly been filled with debt.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/154-1.jpg" /></p>

      <p class="caption"><em>The downward trending line is average earnings divided by a true calculation of inflation—not the United States government’s manipulated ‘CPI’ figure.<br />
      The trend is obvious and one that is replicated in Canada.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">Banks have also played a major role in this, as they make large amounts of money from peddling debt, and it is thus incentivized in their business models. If you tell a corporation, whose entire mandate is literally <em>only</em> to make profit, that they can increase their profit by conning every man and woman they see into taking on large lines of credits, car loans and mortgages, then that is the exact line of action that they will take, and this is exact course of action we have seen pursued. For example, a friend of mine who does not have the funds or income to purchase a home had recently told me that while they were in their bank, they were essentially come onto while asked if they “would like to become a home-owner”. Fortunately, this person was wise enough to tell them to find someone else to fund their ponzi-scheme, but what if that person had been seduced and had taken on yet further debt to purchase a house which they could obviously not afford? Who would be at fault when the eventual day of reckoning came, and that person was underwater, holding onto an asset whose value had largely decreased, with no way to service the now gargantuan amount of debt hovering over their head?</p>

    <p class="indent">Regardless of the answer of where the fault lies, the problem remains. The Finance Minister, the Governor of the Bank of Canada and now major Canadian banks are all coming out in an official capacity to vehemently deny that there is a housing bubble (while using that exact terminology). In the wisdom of the old adage that goes “do not believe anything until it is denied officially”, we can be sure that while giving an appearance of strength and confidence in the stability of the housing market, behind doors they are working up a sweat and truly panicking.</p>

    <p class="indent">Vancouver’s housing prices have already fallen 15%, and another 15% drop has been predicted even by the major banks—Toronto’s housing prices have already fallen 6% and they are merely getting started. These trends will continue and spread to other major cities, specifically Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and Montreal.</p>

    <p class="indent">Cottages and other recreational housing will be hit extremely hard, as will the Canadian condo markets, especially in Vancouver and Toronto where there has been rapid and absolute reckless overbuilding taking place. Although we cannot anticipate whether a depreciation in value as severe as what was seen in the United States (which was about 34%) will occur, the fact of the matter is that this decline could continue for literally about fifteen years (which I will explain). Of course, falling housing prices in and of themselves means very little, but when considering the fact that most Canadians have a large majority of their net worth in their mortgages in the form of equity, it is quickly discovered that the venue by which much of this suffering (the most devastation of personal finance) will be through a depreciation of housing prices.</p>

    <p class="indent">When people’s entire life’s savings evaporate before their very eyes, the extreme personal debt problem that spans from coast to coast in this country will be greatly exasperated. Canadians will be extremely hurt and feel an extreme sense of betrayal, considering their entire lives they were indoctrinated into the belief of ‘home ownership as part of the Canadian middle class dream’. They did as they were told, worked hard, ‘bought’ a home and didn’t cause trouble, yet the rug was pulled out from under them and they now have to suffer.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the long run though, all these people will be doing is simply joining the ranks of the Americans, the Irish, the Icelandish, the Portugese, the Spanish, the Australians and others, who have all seen their citizens bankrupted through the exact same trap, that being a major asset bubble in housing prices. It will be a very tumultuous time as people who lived a debt-fuelled high come crashing down to reality and will perhaps have to face the fact that they will be spending the rest of their life trying to simply break even and bring themselves to a position where they can have the ability to finally sell their home, which once seemed like such a steal but was found out to be a major Trojan horse.</p>

    <p class="indent">On a final note on the subject, I have recently seen a video of a realtor (realtress) on Youtube telling people that she had a get-rich quick scheme for them. She was literally trying to psychologically manipulate unsuspecting people, through showing cleavage and using over the top theatrics, to <em>take equity out of their home</em> (go further into debt) and purchase condos which she admitted were falling in price at a rapid pace. People who listen to her and take her advice will be in a world of pain and may literally be living underwater and in debt for the rest of their life. Young people with meager incomes who are purchasing condos in these extremely overpriced markets will also be taken for a hell of a painful ride. The phrase that has been used across these other countries is “The Lost Generation”, which I think will certainly be adopted in Canada.</p>

    <p class="indent">I have some more bad news, but if you have made it this far you are a strong soul and can take it. This involves a bit of economic education first and foremost, and it goes a little something like this: A depression can be thought of as a period of low demand for an extended amount of time. That is to say, there are products that are produced, but there is no demand for these products—nobody wants to buy them. If this environment generally lasts for under four years we can call it a recession, but anything further than that we can generally call it a depression (there are no hard terms by which to separate them).</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, if we were to look at the demand generated by a single person, it would be their income. Thus, if you made $40,000 dollars with your salary, you would have a demand of $40,000. That is the neoclassical view, except they miss a very major component, and that is the change in debt. Change in debt can either accentuate a person’s demand (if they go into debt) or diminish a person’s demand (if they are paying down debt.) Thus, the more accurate view of someone’s personal demand is their income, plus or minus their change in debt. Now, if we extend that idea to the entire collective of citizens within a society, we can paint another picture. The way that we calculate the demand of an entire nation is by their GDP or gross domestic product, which is basically the ‘income’ of the entire nation. Now, GDP functions as the demand of the nation, but with a twist. The GDP is the income of the nation, but we must also factor in the collective change in debt. If the nation as a whole takes on more debt, the demand for that nation will be greater (GDP + the amount of debt taken on). If the nation as a whole pays down debt, the demand for that entire nation will be smaller, smaller even than the income (GDP) of that entire nation (GDP – the amount of debt paid down). It is exactly like the function of an individual’s personal finances, just on a larger scale.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now that you understand that demand is the nation’s collective income, plus or minus the nation’s collective entering or paying off debt, let’s look at some statistics that are startling to say the least. Although I have completely come to terms with these statistics and am able to live a happy and productive life, they certainly can put a damper on your day, but just understand that as with any of the information found within this book, it’s like a good workout: it hurts at first but in the long run it is completely worth it. With that being said, let’s take a look at some of the data we have on the subject. This is American data mind you, but I can tell you that firstly, nearly 80% of Canadian exports go directly to the United States, so there are huge implications for Canadians with this, but secondly, the Canadian data is not very different.</p>

    <p class="indent">Additionally, we are going to juxtapose and compare this data with the Great Depression of the 1930s, to try and give us a bit of historical perspective. We are already well aware of the pain and anguish of the Great Depression, and if you’re not then simply hop on YouTube and look for some documentaries. It was an excruciating period in history and as we’ve already discussed it was borne out of the exact same thing that created the Great Recession: the collapse of an asset bubble (but instead, it was stocks rather than housing).</p>

    <p class="indent">When we look at the data, to compare the Great Depression to whatever you want to call what is sitting on our doormat (you will understand why the Great Recession simply does not accurately describe our situation in a second), we are forced to come to some rather disturbing conclusions. In the Great Depression, the private sector debt which includes personal debt (households), corporate debt (businesses) and financial debt (banks) was 175% of GDP when the Great Depression began. This debt had to be paid down and this paying down of debt diminished greatly the aggregate demand of the country. This period of delevaraging in the 1930s, all the way from a level of 175% debt to GDP to a manageable level of 50% debt to GDP is what the Great Depression literally was—a mass paying off of debt.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, before the United States began its most recent mass deleveraging beginning in 2009, the debt to GDP was just under <em>300</em>%, as opposed to the Great Depression’s 175%, making the hole out of which it is required for America to climb a total of <em>1.7 times greater</em>.</p>

      <p class="caption"><em>Here you can see clearly what the Great Depression looks like stacked up next to whatever we may end up calling this depression. It should be noted that although the Great Depression began at 175% debt to GDP, a subsequent fall in GDP (as oppose to debt growth) is what pushed it all the way up to 225%</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">As professor of economics Steve Keen has put it “The degree of deleveraging needed to eliminate the Ponzi overhang is therefore much higher today than it was in the 1930s” <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft38" id="fn38"><sup class="frac">38</sup></a>. And what is this Ponzi overhang of which he speaks?</p>

    <p class="indent">If you think back to my analysis of ponzi-schemes in the section on economics you will remember that in Ponzi speculation, capital is put towards ventures that produce no income, they are just speculations that the price is going to go up. If you think back to housing: these Canadian prices in the last decade have doubled, yet the actual income producing functions of these houses have not doubled—they have remained virtually identical. All that money that is spent purchasing these homes are wasted chasing an asset whose value is made up, and when the price falls to finally reach true market value again, that money which was thought to be stored in real estate is literally vaporized and wiped right off of the map. Yet, the debt still remains to be paid. *That* is Ponzi overhang, the likes of which was in 2008 1.7 times larger than was the Ponzi overhang of the 1930s, which ultimately caused the horrors of the Great Depression.</p>

    <p class="indent">Essentially, what the United States now has to do is delever, and pay off their debts. This is a long and painful process—the amount of short-term happiness and pleasure that is acquired by entering into debt is necessarily paid off in terms of sadness and pain in the long term. Now, this is exactly what happened in the Great Depression; debts were paid down until they reached a sustainable level of 50% debt to GDP, and then began the over three quarters of a century long march up to the new ultimate peak which occurred in 2008. In the 1930s, they <em>did</em> eventually pay off their debts. However, it took them an entire decade: ten extremely painful years of deleveraging. Now, if we are to take the slope that was found to occur during the deleveraging of the 1930s, and apply it to America’s colossal peak that they have to work down from we would find that to reach a manageable debt to GDP of 50% would take <em>fifteen years</em>. And that is the unspeakable and hushed up story lurking behind the illusion of our current society: we are literally entering a fifteen year depression. More accurately, for those in the United States, they have been in a depression for five years, and have ten yet to go. Despite Obama, despite what the mainstream press says—it is all hogwash, fifteen years is the measure.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, Canadians are not Americans and the Canadian economy is not the American economy. The sad fact of the nature is that Canada has yet to begin their deleveraging process. We are still, foolishly, seeking the cheap high of cheap debt, and our peak (and thus the beginning of our descent) has yet to begin. But we are on the verge.</p>

    <p class="indent">The ultimate irony of it all is the fact that the neoclassical economists, those who have attained high positions of power in academia and government, were absolutely 100% blind to see this growth in debt (they do not examine debt, for reasons you will have to purchase Steve Keen’s book to fully grasp—which is highly recommended might I add). These economists had the audacity to pat themselves on the back during this large buildup of debt as having ‘ushered in a new era of prosperity’. The same old story—the same tired rhetoric that ‘this time it was different’, this time these self aggrandizing all important divine economists had delivered us into an era where, again, prices could only go up. Ben Bernanke literally referred to this period of ‘tranquility’ as ‘The Great Moderation’. These people sat atop a throne and told we the peasants that we could thank them, the economists, for our ‘prosperity’. However, these so-called intellectuals were found out to be complete farces as they were sitting over a growing, bubbling volcano that was sure to erupt and spur, well, the ongoing collapse of the entire world’s financial market. This doesn’t really have to do much with ‘where are we headed in the future’, but just add it to your list of reasons why you should never, under any circumstances, believe those neoclassical economists who assure you that ‘everything is fine’ and ‘they know what they’re doing’. Literally, they’re drunk at the wheel, they are completely discombobulated, they have no idea what they are doing—YOU reading this now understand more about economics than do these people, and you even knew more about economics before you started this book, just in virtue of neoclassical economists having literally a <em>negative, backwards</em> understanding of economics. Someone who has not received their indoctrination is more capable of figuring where the world is headed and how debt functions than these charlatans.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, as we have just illustrated, when the collective citizenry takes on debt, the aggregate demand of the country expands and it is experienced as a boom. What also happens during this time is that since all of these funds must be created by banks, there is a large expansion of the money supply. When someone takes out a mortgage, the bank certainly does not take the $400,000 and transfer it from a vault to a bank account, it simply types the value into a computer and vuala: they have created money. What happens when this takes place on a large enough scale is that there is a manifestation of inflation, which is an increase in the money supply (something we have already examined). However, when the reverse happens, that is collectively there is a paying down rather than taking on of debt, the money that was created out of thin air disappears as quickly as it was whisked up (which can also be accentuated by people’s reneging on their debt), all of which manifests as a decrease in the total money supply, or <em>deflation.</em></p>

    <p class="indent">This deflationary trend, which can easily be thought of as people paying down or reneging (being unable to pay) their debt, is something that I believe will continue to play out for perhaps three or four more years, maybe fewer. It is hard to say specifically because there are so many external events that can dictate and have an influence on this trend, but let me explain one thing: Ben Bernanke hates deflation. The criminal banking syndicate hates deflation at large, because in an era of deflation all debts become much harder to pay. If you can imagine having to pay $1000 a month during a largely inflationary era—it would be easy, because there is a lot of money floating around. However, that same $1000 debt in a deflationary environment would become much harder to pay, since money is now worth more and there is less of it to be found.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is why central bankers hate deflation. When a country has run up huge debts such as the United States, having a strong, deflated dollar makes it that much more difficult to roll over the debt. Also, in an economy which relies heavily on debt based financing, being able to have a functioning credit based system becomes very hard, or even impossible in a deflationary scenario. Everyone is facing the same difficulty of being unable to pay these debts that become harder and harder to service in virtue of there simply being less money in the system and in the hands of the people.</p>

    <p class="indent">If, as I hope will happen, you take note of the sources that I will list in the end of the book and begin to keep an eye on commentary of current financial news, you will notice that many people have quite a distaste for Ben Bernanke, and like to call him by his unholy nickname of Helicopter Ben. This is because Ben Bernanke gave a speech in which he said in a serious manner that to battle the threat of deflation, there exists the possibility that you could print huge amounts of cash and drop it from helicopters, an idea originally coined by Milton Friedman. The speech was called ‘Deflation: Making Sure “It” Doesn’t Happen Here’. It is also important to note that Ben Bernanke’s supposed field of ‘expertise’ is in the Great Depression, which was a hugely deflationary episode. That is what Bernanke wants to avoid, and to do it, he will not be afraid to fire up the printing presses.</p>

    <p class="indent">This gung-ho attitude of money creation, and doubling and tripling the size of base money in the United States is why many well respected economists are calling for the eventual collapse of the American dollar.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/163-1.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">These economists, both within and outside of the mainstream, are convinced that a hyperinflationary episode is inevitable, and I would have to agree with them. It would appear to me to be nearly impossible that Ben Bernanke and the FED, who have already engaged in massive ‘Quantitative Easings’ (buying of assets) and secret loans numbering in the trillions of dollars, are going to find the self restraint within themselves to not hit the big shiny red ‘PRINT’ button. (Ben Bernanke is also called CTRL+P for that very reason). However, once we begin to speculate when the dollar is going to face a hyperinflationary episode, we run into a lot of snags. For example, many investors seek the US dollar as a safe-haven from the turmoil of the rest of the financial world, and this leads to a strengthening of the dollar. Also, the Anglo-American empire relies on the dollar being strong to retain their ‘extraordinary privilege’ of possessing the world’s reserve currency, which means that there are some very powerful (and sinister) forces behind it, literally doing whatever is necessary, legal or otherwise, to keep it strong and the pre-eminent currency of the world. I myself have already been blown away by how well those in power are able to ‘kick the can down the road’ or ‘extend and pretend’ as it were, so I am very hesitant to pin a date on this event happening, although I will say I do believe it will happen eventually. Why? I believe this because for it not to happen, it would go against literally thousands of years of history and historical precedents.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is certainly not the first time the world has been in such a situation, where a fiat currency has reached the brink of disaster. Each and every time these crises have been personified by huge expansion of government power (including militaristic), huge debts and huge welfare systems--can we see any modern day parallels? These huge debt-based undertakings of the United States are all completely unsustainable and <em>will</em> lead to a crash one day. There will be some major commotion as the budgets needed to continue and uphold this gigantic warfare/welfare system of the United States are simply out of this world. Medicare, Medicaid, social security and all these literal debts are owed to the older, retiring Boomer generation, yet there is absolutely no money to pay for it. Things that cannot go on forever won’t. Remember the term fiat currency and remember that since the beginning of time not a single fiat currency has survived—they have all, without variation, reached untimely and painful deaths. The average lifespan for a fiat currency is 41 years. The US dollar became a fiat currency in 1971. This fiat currency <em>will not</em> survive.</p>

    <p class="indent">This book alone (of which economics is only 1/3 of the focus) has exposed the fact that all the world’s major banks are insolvent, that the currencies which we currently use are heading down a one-way track to destruction and that our economic system is built on a foundation of perpetual exponential growth, which is simply impossible in today’s physical reality. This is something which I wish could be explained to that woman I saw on the piece by the CBC which seems like so long ago by now. This is because, if it was explained properly, then I could also demonstrate to her what I am about to impart on you, which is a way to keep oneself financially secure in the coming turmoil, and perhaps even make some very good returns in the process.</p>

    <p class="indent">The truth is that this financial crash we are facing is all too familiar throughout the course of history. What we are experiencing now with the world becoming awash in paper money is in fact the norm, not the exception. Monetary history certainly moves in cycles and to illustrate this, consider this quote from 1841, and see just how true it rings in today’s society:</p>

    <p class="nonindent">“New houses were built in every direction, and an illusory prosperity shown over the land, and so dazzled the eyes of the whole nation, that none could see the dark cloud on the horizon announcing the storm that was too rapidly approaching” Charles Mackay – Extraordinary Opular Delusions And The Madness Of Crowds, 1841</p>

    <p class="indent">Sound familiar? It is true that cycles occur throughout history, and one obvious cycle takes place when nations start to mess around with this intoxicating drug of fiat currencies. At first, people really do like holding onto paper and paper-denominated assets such as stocks. It certainly is more convenient, and initially when this paper money is managed in a prudent manner there is sufficient trust in the issuer of that currency. When these governments are able to manage their books correctly, and are not lured into every politician’s fantasy of promising the largest military and welfare state imaginable, the prospects for the future of these currencies look good.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, invariably the greed attached to fiat currencies takes over, and a war machine and pervasive welfare system takes root (this is what happened in Ancient Rome as well—a collapsing empire which draws many parallels with the modern United States). Before long the currency supply starts to become diluted, and people no longer feel safe storing their wealth in paper. At this point, the so-called smart money begins to move their wealth into <em>real assets</em>, things that are tangible in the real world (unlike stocks and fiat currencies). This was even taught in my economics courses at UBC; certain things derive their value from the product themselves (real assets) while financial assets are fictional entities bound to paper, which usually just amounts to an IOU ‘x’ amount of dollars. This ability for the person on the other end of the deal to uphold their part of IOU is called counter-party risk, and let me tell you, the risk associated with the counter party being unable to fulfill their end of the deal is exploding in what I believe is an exponential rate (based on the accelerating pace of this collapse).</p>

    </div>

    <p class="indent">For example, there was once a small investment firm called MF Global Holdings-- I say was because as of October 31<sup class="frac">st</sup> 2011, the firm has declared bankruptcy and ceases to exist. The reason for this abrupt and appalling failure of the company was due to the fact that the CEO of the company, a cocky and greedy financial and political crook named Jon Corzine, used the magic of derivatives to place what amounted to a gargantuan bet on what he felt was a ‘sure thing’ in the European debt market. However, his instincts (obviously deluded by his incessant need to place others in risk for personal profit) proved to be wrong, and the bet cost him the entire value of the company. However, something very corrupt and perverse happened when MF Global declared bankruptcy: $1.2 billion (1,200,000,000) of customer funds ‘vanished’. Right out of their bank accounts—it was there, and then it wasn’t. When MF Global went digging to try and find it, they said that the money had ‘vaporized’. Literally, they said it was so chaotic in the final days of MF Global that the money simply disappeared. However, it was later found out that the money ended up in accounts at the firm JP Morgan, who <em>coincidentally</em> just so happened to be the creditor to MF Global and thus faced a loss if MF Global went down and they did not receive their lent money, which by some apparent coincidence was also valued at $1.2 billion. Still to this day, these customers have not received their money back. It is still ‘disappeared’, as these clients continue an ongoing legal battle trying to get back their money. However, these individuals will most likely come away with nothing more than an extremely harsh and brutal lesson on exactly what counter-party risk is.</p>

    <p class="indent">After the debacle of MF Global, Regulators at the American Securities and Exchange Commission promptly said that it was the last time it would ever happen—but this has turned out not to be the case. After a company called Peregrine Financial declared bankruptcy in July of 2012, $220 million (220,000,000) was also ‘disappeared’. The Royal Bank of Scotland had in July of 2012 also experienced a so-called ‘technical glitch’ wherein the bank was unable to service their customer’s ATM withdrawals for nearly 2 weeks. Also in July of 2012, a Russian bank called Sberbank had a long period where they were unable to service their customer’s ATM withdrawals—they too blamed it on an apparent ‘technical glitch’. However, the proposal that these were simply technical glitches flies in the face of reality. The truth is that in anticipation of bank runs across Europe, people had been for weeks forming long lines, trying to withdraw as much cash as quickly as possible before the true insolvency of these banks were discovered. In Germany now, sales of luxury items are beginning to skyrocket, as people move their wealth into more secure ‘real assets’ and out of the Euro, which many people <span class="strike">feel</span> know is destined to fail and collapse.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is what collapse looks like, and this is just the beginning of what we are sitting over. To eliminate counter-party risk, and hedge against coming financial calamity, the best thing to do is to move wealth into real assets, out of stocks and real estate and into gold and silver. It may seem absurd to recommend that people purchase gold and silver, especially if you do not know the historical context and the role that these two precious metals have served as a store of value since literally the beginning of civilization. However, facts speak for themselves. In 2001, gold was at about $280 USD dollar per ounce. This was when people felt happy holding onto paper, but this is also when the paradigm began to end and when sentiments began to change. Based on the calculations and research conducted by knowledgeable economists whose work I respect, the minimum price gold must reach in the transition from a paper asset paradigm to a real asset paradigm is over $5000 per ounce. This is because gold historically does what can only be described as ‘accounting’ for all the money printing that occurs. When the world becomes awash in paper, the wealth that is stolen during the money printing moves into precious metals and other real assets—it is transferred not destroyed. Simply to account for all of the money creation that has occurred since 2001, gold to accomplish the accounting that it has historically done over, and over throughout history as paper currencies collapse, would have to reach about $5000 USD (at the level of money printing that had been reached in 2011).</p>

    <p class="indent">Since the beginning of time, every fiat currency has invariably collapsed and literally during each and every time this has occurred, the thing that has risen to the fore to soak up the lost value of the diluted currency and to finally deal a death blow to the currency has been gold. If you have not looked into the role gold has played as a store of value since the beginning of time itself, you may be hesitant (as you should be) and skeptical that a ‘piece of metal’ can have any worth and value, besides looking shiny. Again, if you are not aware of the history of currency and gold, you may think that the last time that gold has done this accounting may be in say, the 1600s. If you think this, you are dead wrong and need to seriously look into the history of money and currencies. The fact is that the latest time this has happened, where gold began to take off to rise in value and do the ‘accounting’ for all the printed money was in fact 1980. To give you an idea of how gold functions as an accountant for the mishaps and poor decisions of government (which is about the only thing more plentiful these days than paper money), I will tell an abbreviated version of how gold fulfilled its role as the major counterbalance to the foolishness of governments as it escalated over 2400% in value in under a decade in 1970. The story goes a little something like this…</p>

    <p class="indent">On December 31<sup class="frac">st</sup>, 1974, President Gerald Ford signed into law legislation that made it legal for citizens of the United States to once again purchase and posses gold (why it had to be made legal is a long story in and of itself, one that is told in other places and is not of a high enough relevancy and importance to be included in this particular book). At this point in time, gold was literally $35 per ounce. Of course during this period, it was not anticipated by the general public that a rapid rise in price would occur—but it did. Before gold was made legal, few people were intrigued by the idea of holding onto gold, and most people preferred their paper currencies. But by 1974, gold had almost climbed all the way to $200 per ounce. In 1978, it finally broke the $200 per ounce barrier and a new paradigm had been entered—all of a sudden the masses wanted gold. Major mainstream publications such as <em>Time</em> magazine would run articles on this massive shift in public perception. During the run up, the point of $300 dollars per ounce had been reach, and warnings began to ring from mainstream economists that the value was headed for a crash. However, they were (like usual) completely wrong, as gold continued to climb. An article from Time magazine in 1980 read “In cities throughout the U.S. and Europe, people by the thousands lined up at jewelry and coin shops, lured by newspaper headlines of eye-popping new prices for gold and silver, and even by hourly news broadcasts on the radio”.</p>

    <p class="indent">The only thing that had occurred was a shift in public perception, and at that point, all of a sudden the second of the most primal investment instincts, greed (instead of fear) began to take root. This modern day gold rush (which occurred only 32 years ago) pushed gold all the way from a measly sum of $35 dollars per gold, all the way up until $850 per ounce; literally over a 2400% rise in price, an increase by a factor of 24 in under a decade.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, if we take what we know about herd mentality and trends, we can be sure of one thing: if there are hourly updates on the radio about the price of gold, with the mainstream news publications running major articles on gold, and even local news broadcasts talking about the precious metals fever that has stricken their respective city—do we really think that this is the proper time to buy? The truth is that the herd is always last to the party, the mainstream always shows up late. If it is being broadcast on the news, and every single Joe Schmo in your neighborhood is talking about gold—chances are it is probably not a good time to enter the market (this works for almost anything). This is why if there were currently news broadcasts running on television about how people were feverishly trying to get their hands on gold and silver, it would appear to help my credibility, but the truth is that it would be too late. The real returns in the run up in 1980 were not made by those who purchased at $600, or $700, as the boom was coming to a head. The real returns were made by those who purchased early on, wisely, before the others. Indeed, the price of gold was pushed by the herd into a bubble of its own in 1980, and thereafter returned to prices closer to $400 per ounce.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, if you consider what I have said earlier, that just to account for all the money that has been printed <em>to this point,</em> gold will have to reach around $5000 per ounce, then the idea of an over 300% return will certainly appear seductive and luring. However, it is not with greed in their collective eyes that I would hope the middle class would be able to conduct their research and come to the conclusion that in fact, if they want to protect their assets they had better move some wealth into precious metals. It is for the latter reason—the protection and security that I would hope people would make such a move. Do yourself a favour right now, and although it may be painful, look on YouTube for a documentary by Journeyman Pictures called ‘Gold For Bread – Zimbabwe’. It is a harsh tale, but under eight minutes long, and extremely important. I would say more about it but I sincerely want you to watch it, so I will not comment on what is shown in that documentary. You will be able to figure it out.</p>

    <p class="indent">Thus I would ask of you to not to take my word as a sermon and blindly move your wealth into precious metals in anticipation of major returns, but to consider the education I have attempted to give on the subject. The focus of this book is not on gold and the role it has played throughout the centuries as a store of value, nor is even probably 5% of the book related to gold whatsoever. Thus, this book is certainly not the academic authority on the issue, and is of itself most likely not grounds enough for you to come to a rational and well thought out decision that it would be prudent to move wealth into real assets such as gold and silver. However, I have included a section on precious metals because I believe, based on my research, that this is one of the premiere ways for people to hedge themselves against the coming calamity which has been painstakingly documented in this book. I do not want to leave you with only problems and no solutions--that would hardly be a fair and kind thing to do. Thus, you should begin your own research into what role gold has played during times of economic collapse and the role gold and silver has played as the only true and consistent form of money over time, and based on that you should rationally examine where you are financially and then make your decision. This section was not to advise you to buy gold, it was to demonstrate to you that gold is not just a ‘barbarous relic’-it is a real and bona fide store of value and has been since before the time of Christ and will continue to be for as long as there are humans on this Earth.</p>

    <p class="indent">In conclusions for my short-term economic outlook, let me finish with such: I see continued economic peril occurring as banks across the world are discovered to be insolvent, and currencies begin to lose value and ultimately collapse.</p>

    <p class="indent">In Canada specifically I see a housing crash that need not be very significant to cause a great amount of harm—a relatively small devaluation (which is inevitable) will expose what the pain of a <span class="strike">154</span> 164.7% debt to income ratio is really all about. Those who are holding onto mortgages, specifically on condos in markets like Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary and Edmonton will be plunged into negative equity and may spend a very good portion of their life trying to work back up to a net worth of $0. The economy will continue to be stagnant, as the real economy (such as manufacturing) is shipped overseas, and our “debt fuelled economy” (to use the Governor of The Bank Of Canada Mark Carney’s words) will continue its abysmal run of negligible growth, such as the 0.1% growth experienced in May of 2012. (Since I have written this, the Q3 2012 GDP growth has come out at 0.1%). I think it is very likely that once these major headwinds from a slowdown in China, a collapse in Europe and the continuing deleveraging of America reach Canada, we will be pushed rather quickly into another recession. The question is: when do we begin deleveraging ourselves, and for how long will we live in a landscape of extremely poor aggregate demand? Based on the work of prodigal economists that I have studied, I have been forced to conclude that the deleveraging begins when housing starts to head downwards, and that this depression-like era will last for at least a five years, and possibly ten to fifteen years.</p>

    <p class="indent">Those holding onto mortgages, like I have said before, will suffer greatly. Those who hold their funds in a bank may come to some very harsh realities if the banks are found to be insolvent and they are therefore unable to withdraw their savings. Prime Minister Harper, being in bed with the banks will continue to bail-out the banks on taxpayer dollar whenever they ask for it--the problem with that being the fact that there will be no money in the pockets of Canadians to steal to fork over to these banks. However, that will not stop the economic thinking pervasive these days of ‘save the banks at all possible costs, be it monetary or human’.</p>

    <p class="indent">Those who are wise and move out of real estate, hold onto liquidity in the form of their nation’s currency to hedge against deflation, and gold and silver to hedge against hyperinflation and counter-party risk will find that their net worth remains steady, or even increases (with the possibility of major increases). These will be the same people who keep a steady eye on current events, especially financial events, and are able to tread through the waters of the upcoming years with a general degree of safety and security. Those who are plugged into the matrix of distraction television and debt based consumption will be living in extremely desperate times. Those who have purchased quads, boats, trucks and televisions and lived a lavish lifestyle all by borrowing with debt will suffer greatly.</p>

    <p class="indent">I should add too, just so I am on the record having said this, that seniors and Baby Boomers who are reaching retirement age will also have a very hard run of things. It was recently released in a CIBC report that over 50% of those retiring still carry debt. Factor that in with the negative real interest rates offered by banks (which bleed pensioners of their savings), combined with the fact that there is not enough tax revenue saved to pay for the social security which has been promised and you find there is a real crunch amongst those who felt they would be looked after when they reached the age of retirement.</p>

    <p class="indent">The population pyramid in Canada is definitely skewed towards the era of the Boomers and it will be virtually impossible for all the promises made to those reaching retirement age to be kept. Of course, those promises are already being broken, notably with Prime Minister Harper raising the age needed to collect old-age security, so again I am hardly being ‘clairvoyant’ and am mostly just commenting on trends which have already long since started.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/ding.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">Based on the analysis already conducted on depletion of fossil fuels, specifically oil, it should come as no surprise that I have a firm belief that oil will continue to become less accessible for every man, woman and child on Earth. I call back to the fact that in the beginning of the 1970s, oil was hovering at around a single dollar ($1) per barrel. Juxtapose this with the fact that oil peaked at around $147 dollars a barrel in July of 2008 before plummeting to around $60 dollars per barrel shortly thereafter. Growing at a factor of 147, or a 14700% increase in under fourty years is a perfect illustration of where the price of oil will be headed. However, for reasons recently discussed, such as the effect of inflation and deflation, it is not as simple as just pegging a number to the price of oil, and for example saying “it will head directly to $200”. As we have seen from the historical precedent of 2008, there is a definite ceiling the price of oil can reach before the entire globalized economic system we have comes screeching to a halt. This is the fault that Jeffrey Rubin, an economist at CIBC made when he boldly proclaimed that oil would reach $200 a barrel by 2012—he was unable to account for the severe consequences that occur when our system of creation and distribution of goods based on fossil fuels became too expensive to uphold.</p>

    <p class="indent">Also, it must be realized that the availability of oil is only one half of the equation when it comes to price, the other half of course being the currency with which it is purchased. That is why there remains the distinct possibility that under an inflationary environment oil could easily reach $400 a barrel (based on a loss of the value of the currency) whereas in a deflationary environment, which is what we experienced for a very long portion of 2012, the price of oil could continue dropping below $80.</p>

    <p class="indent">Of course, when the price of oil drops it has huge repercussions for Canada, whose major stock exchange, the TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) is tied very directly to energy costs. When the price of oil drops, so does the income of Canada to a large degree. We are even seeing entire Albertan oil projects having to be put on hold as the profit margins are not high enough for firms to make the decision to undergo the construction necessary to extract oil in the vary laborious process used in the tar sands. The industry during these times will often blame the lack of new projects on “unforeseen maintenance activities” and other red herrings which serve to distract from the reality that when dealing with the extraction of tar sands oil, which is an extremely expensive and inefficient way to obtain our black gold, unless the price of oil is very high it is simply not profitable to undergo such herculean projects.</p>

    <p class="indent">The trend of oil becoming more costly to extract and distribute is easy to understand, however the effects that this will have are very difficult to comprehend at first glance, simply because they are so vast and all-encompassing. Someone who is considering for the first time our reliance on oil to fuel our modern day lifestyles may simply be unable to fully grasp how deep down the roots really dig. For example, for every calorie of food we purchase from the store, there are literally 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy that were expended to get that one calorie of food energy there (Pfeiffer). When the price of those 10 calories of hydrocarbons continues to rise and rise, it is not difficult to see what the implications will be for those who are already living paycheque to paycheque, barely able to afford the necessary food to survive—and I am talking about North America specifically here.</p>

    <p class="indent">Additionally, do consider for a moment the way that food is created and distributed in our modern, western society. A single farmer harvests large, vast fields with huge machines that are powered by fossil fuels. Everything from tilling the ground, to planting the seeds, to harvesting the food crops is accomplished by very small numbers of people operating on enormous plots of land, all powered by fossil fuel run machines. Consider too that all herbicides and pesticides, which are used in huge quantities by farmers, are created with a process which requires fossil fuels. Consider as well the fact that the fertilizer which farmers use are rich in nitrogen and this is what allows farmers to have such large crop output and this ability to create artificial fertilizer is what spawned ‘The Green Revolution’, allowing humanity to create and sustain seven billion (7,000,000,000) people on the planet. (Just to put that into perspective, you and I combined account for 0.00000002% of the planet’s population, despite how important our personal lives feel).</p>

    <p class="indent">The Green Revolution, as it has been called, is all well and good except for the fact that artificial nitrogen (fertilizer) is created by a process called the Haber-Bosch process which is completely reliant on fossil fuels. After the herbicides, pesticides, fertilizer, and huge fossil fueled machines create and harvest the food, then what’s left is to transport it. This is done in full by fossil fuels. Products are shipped from all over the world, and when they finally are able to make the trip across entire oceans (transported by fossil fuels) they are then loaded onto huge shipping trucks, which transport them across entire countries to where they can finally be accessed by consumers in supermarkets. The entire transportation process is one hundred percent linked with fossil fuels—there are no electric shipping trucks transporting food to your local supermarket. To top it off, from that point the consumers (ourselves) must get to the supermarket and back home, which in today’s era means driving to and from the supermarket. At each point along the production of food, to the consumption of food, there is an ever increasing price tag accounting for the price of the fossil fuels. That is why there is a book written by Dale Allen Pfeiffer called ‘Eating Fossil Fuels’—we don’t literally take them and put them into our mouths, but without them our food would not exist. If you can’t see why this is troubling, just hop back to the chapter on oil production and refamiliarize yourself with the trends that are occurring in oil. However, like I have said at the outset of this chapter, the ‘end of the world as we know it’, does not mean the ‘end of the world’—it means change. However this book would not be complete without mentioning which is certainly one of the more pernicious trends taking place across the world.</p>

    <p class="indent">Currently as it stands there are over 7 billion (7,000,000,000) people living on the planet. At the beginning of the 19<sup class="frac">th</sup> century, there were around only a billion (1,000,000,000) people living on the planet and by the beginning of the 20<sup class="frac">th</sup> century that figure had only reached 2 billion (2,000,000,000). As we have already learned with the examination of environmental carrying capacities, it is true that the limits to population are based on the amount of energy the species can acquire from the surrounding environment and therefore it is true that the ability for humans to grow to a population of seven billion has been directly because of its ability to extract energy from fossil fuels. It is not necessarily true that therefore when we lose our ability to extract those levels of energy from fossil fuels that we will necessarily lose the population which has corresponded with a spike in our energy extraction. However, I have noticed a pattern from economics that I believe applies to human population.</p>

    <p class="indent">My knowledge about the creation of asset bubbles has led me to a belief that we are in a current bubble in terms of human population. This part of the book will probably seem controversial but I have added it because I think this work would be incomplete without mentioning the possibility of what I am about to get into.</p>

    <p class="indent">Firstly, let’s re-examine what a bubble in terms of housing prices really is, just to give ourselves a reminder of what I mean when I say this. A housing bubble is created when credit (debt) is made easily available to every person who walks through a door of a bank. This is because people who would not normally have the money to do so begin to make bids on houses they would not otherwise be able to afford. When debt is taken on in a collective capacity it has the effect of cranking the housing prices to unprecedented and otherwise unimaginable heights—this growth occurs in an exponential fashion, as opposed to more normal and sustainable linear growth. This has the collective population foolishly thinking they have hit the jackpot, and are now rich and wealthy with possession of their home, which let’s say has risen from $200,000 to $400,000 dollars. This of course is until any one of a handful of factors begin to occur (which we have documented extensively in the chapter on economics). These factors, most often a peak in the ability to take on debt, or an economic slowdown has the effect of bringing down the housing prices to more historical norms, and with it the collectively held delusion of wealth suddenly evaporates, and the market is shown for what it truly is: a bunch of people bidding up prices on houses they cannot afford with money they didn’t have to begin with.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now if you bring the example back to human population you will see begin to see parallels. I will put the economic parallel in brackets so you can see it clearly. In terms of human population, we once had a hard limit, which was the energy we could acquire from our food sources and the burning of wood (in the housing bubble example the hard limit is the money available in the society). However, with the advent of fossil fuels (cheap debt), we were able to raise a human family of over 7,000,000,000 (rapid price increases)—completely without thinking or understanding our actions, and completely unpredictably. We wallow, just as those homeowners did, in the sunlight of our new prosperity, and feel that the celebration will never end. However, as we reach limits of oil extraction (debt expansion) which we did not anticipate, the massive accelerant of cheap oil (cheap debt) suddenly disappears. If this is truly a bubble, what we are left with is a human population which, like housing prices in an asset bubble, is ultimately unsustainable, and devoid of its artificial booster must necessarily return back down to levels based closer to those found in historical precedents.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now I am not a eugenicist, and do not abide by the genocidal teachings of my economics classes, so please understand where I come from when I say that I believe there may be a population die-off in the future. As with most of the factors mentioned in this book, I sincerely hope it does not have to come to that. However, to not mention my observations would go against the purpose of this book, so it is out of a sense of obligation that I list this as a possibility in the future, and certainly not out of my own desires.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is true that I have a firm belief that our species will come up with very new and inventive ways of sustaining our current population. Truly, if the issue had been addressed at its most logical point, that likely being the OPEC fuel embargo and its subsequent energy crisis, I may not have to come to you as a reporter and warn of the chance of die-off in the human population. If in 1973, when then President Jimmy Carter called for a movement towards sustainable energy and the world had listened, then it is extremely possible that there would already be real and tangible solutions at hand. Mankind has gone through many energy transitions over the course of history, the quickest of which took fourty years, but throughout history we have always moved from a less energy dense matter to a more energy dense matter (wood to coal, coal to oil). Never before has humanity collectively made an energy transition from a more energy dense matter to a less energy dense matter, which is what is being asked for with a transition to solar or wind energy (our two current best alternatives).</p>

    <p class="indent">Therefore, while it is true that I believe there exist ways in which we could sustain seven billion (7,000,000,000) people on the Earth, I simply have not seen enough evidence in my research that points towards a smooth transition. We can see this from the indecision of modern day politicians—there is still no political will to deal with this looming energy and food crisis. The corporate politicians, eternally beholden to the money of big oil, continue to stonewall movements towards sustainability. Rather than coming out and admitting there is a problem, and from that point creating a proactive plan towards sustainability, it is far more likely that those in power will continue letting things fall apart and then ‘managing the collapse’—which is an extremely important topic which will be covered more deeply towards the end of the chapter.</p>

    <p class="indent">The fact of the matter is that politicians play very specific psychological tricks out of a very specific playbook, these strategies and tactics being what allows them to be elected. All top level politicians (I am thinking President Obama in particular) have one very specific goal in mind, and that is to be elected. And to be elected you must speak in an eternally optimistic tone, always about ‘restoring America’, and always in substitution of speaking honestly about the problems at hand. If two candidates are running for President and one offers a return to the ‘glory days’ of America with no work involved, while the other one speaks about the coming energy crisis and a need to rapidly and fundamentally change our oil-driven way of life, obviously the first candidate will be better received.</p>

    <p class="indent">Who then will create the uproar that will drive the political will that will force the hand of these politicians? Will it come from the corporate media?—of course not. Will it come from the masses, who currently are much more inclined to distract themselves with ‘reality’ television and the divorce of Tom Cruise than they are to examine their owns lives, let alone where the world is headed?—possibly, although I sincerely doubt there is time left to steer clear of major hardships. Again, based on the fact that these trends are causing major turmoil in the world and straining the limits of the world to sustain this population <em>right now</em> signals to me that the window of opportunity for creating the critical mass necessary to create enough political will to completely avoid a dip in population has long since passed—possibly by decades even.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, the will to survive is extremely strong (as I’m sure you know) and the people who are vulnerable to face starvation will obviously not go down with a wimper. I should note also that when I say ‘those who are vulnerable to face starvation’, I certainly do not mean only those living in poorer, ‘developing’ nations. In this crisis, those in the ‘developed’ countries are extremely susceptible and will possibly be the hardest hit out of all. We can already see that trend occurring across the world where citizens of Westernized countries are beginning to face a reality of starvation. One such example is a report out of the UK’s Daily Mail detailing how Greek children are being abandoned by their parents on the streets. This is a symptom of a world-wide depression, akin to that found in the 1930s. However, there is a biological reality, which states that when people’s stomachs are hungry and the price of food reaches a certain critical point, revolution is quick to follow.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is not difficult to understand, nor is it difficult to see different scenarios of this throughout history. When the people’s backs are pushed against the wall, and food prices reach a certain percent of income which makes it simply too difficult to survive on a day to day basis, people take to the streets. This has been <em>part</em> of the global uprising that has been occurring steadily since early 2011 which began in Tunisia. I say <em>part</em> of the uprising because there are obviously many, many factors at play whenever social unrest occurs, and it is certainly foolish to in that assessment cast out the possibility that there are foul factors at play, such as the influence of yet more clandestinely led CIA coups. However, in particular, these uprisings have had something that has never been so strong, and that is global solidarity. This is also because of one of the exponential curves we have examined, that being the exponential growth of computing technology, something we have yet to touch on in this chapter.</p>

    <p class="indent">These revolutions and uprisings, social unrests and demonstrations have never been so interconnected. Never before has there been the ability for a livestream, that being someone broadcasting their cellphone’s video camera over the internet, to show first-hand, live, tanks rolling down streets in Cairo, or shotgun wielding police breaking into and arresting those in Zuccoti Park in New York. Rather than use the very corrupt and manipulated mainstream press as the middleman for information, the internet has allowed activists and revolutionaries across the world to contact and organize with eachother in a way that completely circumvents national boundaries.</p>

    <p class="indent">This has had a snowballing effect, as the winds of social revolution blow across the world, from North Africa, to the Middle East, to Europe and all the way through to North America. Each country’s social movement builds upon the successes and failures of the others, as they are able to communicate directly and witness firsthand strategies and tactics through especially YouTube and Livestream. The response by those in power has invariably been to use military and police forces to violently crush dissent, meanwhile using computer technology and various government agencies to conduct surveillance on, infiltrate and sabotage the rebellions. This has been done by in particular singling out and attacking organizers of demonstrations oftentimes by using trumped up and fabricated charges to arrest and incarcerate main organizers and other prominent voices. These national governments have also the aid of the most complicated and sophisticated computer technology ever known on Earth, and have been therefore able to use literally endless amounts of surveillance to track, censor and crack down on activists. The infiltration tactics that they have used have not changed since the uprisings of the 1960s, with undercover agents working themselves within and up to prominent ranks within the revolutionary organizations, and once reaching a point of trust using their power within the group to leak information and steer the groups into poor decisions which ultimately undermine the message and actions the group attempts to create.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, the internet, and by extension the extreme growth and affordability of potent modern day technology (something as typical as live-streaming in 720P on an average iPhone 4) has also allowed those wishing to dissent and rise up against corrupt regimes to organize themselves in a particularly effective fashion. I can use firsthand experience in painting this picture: in just a week, and using voice over IP software to conduct meetings, while using Facebook and email lists to spread the word, a very small group of activists including myself were able to organize a roughly 500 person rally in response to the blatant election fraud conducted by the Conservative party in Canada’s 2011 national election. As someone who has had no experience whatsoever in organizing rallies, and while simultaneously being in school, creating a turnout of such magnitude was truly unprecedented and would have certainly been impossible considering my lack of presence in the activism community had it not been for the organizational tools of the internet. This rally ended up making national news and had hundreds of stories ran on it from coast-to-coast in Canada, an accomplishment which would simply be wishful thinking if it were not for the effectiveness of mobilizing the citizenry via the internet.</p>

    <p class="indent">The tool of using the internet has also been behind the record breaking number of people who have been taking a stand against their government’s policies in the province of Quebec. Filling streets for as far as the eye can see, with numbers well over 100,000, which I speculate is some of the largest single mass demonstrations in Canadian history, demonstrates the power that is being afforded to those who are able to circumvent the traditional channels of communication such as the corporate media, and organize and mobilize themselves through use of a neutral third party applications such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>

    <p class="indent">Certainly this power has those pulling the strings within the traditional oligarchy very frightened. From this, we have seen what can only be described as extremely disturbing legislation being put forward, simultaneously, across many nations. It is hardly possible to keep up with all the new legislations: SOPA, PIPA, CISPA, ACTA and now most recently the ‘Transpacific Partnership’, which is a wide-scoping ostensible ‘trade agreement’ with draconian measures and enforcement policies even for what is considered very normal internet activity. This legislation in particular is alarming because the negotiations have all taken place in secret, out of the scrutiny of the public eye. This is certainly because of the difficulty governments have had in passing their legislation through the normal venue of actual democratic debate, thanks again to the organizational ability given to activists by the web. Of course, those in power will not easily relinquish that power they have worked so hard to acquire. These same plutocrats who have risen to power in countries across the world have often done so using underhanded and illegal methods, and it is to be expected that they will not cease their evil antics in their attempts to maintain power. Therefore, clandestine backdoor agreements are naturally their next course of action which has been the route chosen after the defeat of ACTA, SOPA and PIPA, and the Canadian Bill C-30.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is also extremely important to note that when I mentioned earlier that these bills are being introduced simultaneously, what is meant is that we are led to believe these legislations have appeared spontaneously in countries spanning across several continents. It is extremely pernicious and insidious, but in February of 2012, legislation was simultaneously (within days of eachother) introduced in the respective political institutions of the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and Canada. This legislation was literally <em>exactly</em> the same in what it attempted to achieve, which was <em>warrantless internet surveillance</em>. Essentially, the legislation would allow law enforcement to conduct surveillance on and obtain information and data about users of the internet <em>without getting proper legal authority from a judge</em>. Any and all citizens of the country could therefore be spied upon infinitely and have any and all internet data (web usage, time spent on which websites) tracked by the police for any reason. Additionally, in each of these countries there was a gag order introduced that disallowed the citizens to find out whether or not they were in fact being surveilled. The sickening part of it is that this legislation was being passed as a ‘Protecting Children From Internet Predators’ act in each and all of the countries named. The reason why this legislation was introduced and attempted to be passed concurrently in these seemingly ‘autonomous and independent’ states is something that I do not have the time or space to cover in this book, but will touch on towards the end of this chapter. It is something that is definitely, without a doubt demanding to be examined, but considering the context and what I have set out to cover in this book, it will have to wait for another time for its full analysis. Therefore we will move back to our study of where the trends we have examined in this book are leading us.</p>

    <p class="indent">Of course, besides the growing food crisis, and the advancing ability for people around the world to organize effectively on a supranational basis with the internet, there is yet another major trend that will shape our future and that is the imminent debt collapse, and the concurrent and pervasive economic collapse that will surely follow. As we have already seen from our analysis of the economic system, there are certain inevitabilities that <em>must</em> be faced. In what period of time it takes to manifest is unknown and dependent upon far too many handfuls of variables to reasonably predict, but it is quickly approaching. Again, this is not a new trend that is specific to the 21<sup class="frac">st</sup> century, these sort of economic collapses have instead been the norm throughout history. As it has been said “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes”. If we are to do a historical analysis of what arises out of economic collapse and try to apply that knowledge to the modern day, it exposes that we are, just like the past, extremely vulnerable to a major political reorganization—especially away from a democratic, free society and towards a totalitarian and fanatical state.</p>

    <p class="indent">Within any nation that is suffering economic collapse it inevitably leads to a political collapse. The status quo is simply not working for the masses and social discontent begins to bubble. There is also major scapegoating and hate-filled rhetoric that rises to the fore—issues that were simply glossed over while ‘times were good’ now become issues that are played out often violently across the country. Again, we can look to the more historic times of the crash that came out of the 1930’s Great Depression and see this typical development. It was a time when people were eager to trade off their freedoms and liberties to demagogues who promised more security: both financial and militaristic. In the 1930s liberal democracy as a model began to disintegrate, while very radical communist and fascist regimes rose to the fore. The crash of the 1930s is specifically <em>what</em> created the political conditions necessary to bring in Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and Fumimaro Konoe. However less known is that a corporate coup d’état was attempted in the United States, when wealthy business interests attempted to commission General Smedley Butler to lead an armed force onto the White House and remove Franklin Deleanor Roosevelt from power. However to look for evidence of these trends, we need not look backwards nearly a century as the very same scenarios are now rising to the fore in the modern day. Therefore, it takes some of the difficulty of speculation off of the table as we can already observe these trends beginning; the only question now is not a matter of ‘what and when’ but how deep and for how long?</p>

    <p class="indent">A particular case study which illustrates the scenario of economic collapse turning into political collapse is the situation currently playing out in Greece. The literal birthplace of democracy has had an extremely tumultuous political run in the last two years, as it has been thrust in the spotlight of the world because of its total insolvency and required continual bailouts which have turned the small country into an economic slaughterhouse. The story of Greece’s political scene is tantamount to have an entire book written on it, but in particular to illustrate the point I am hoping to drive home, I am going to reference in particular a Greek political party called the ‘Golden Dawn’.</p>

    <p class="indent">The Golden Dawn party is a type of neo-Nazi party, considered to be the ‘extreme right’ of Greece. Their political platform is literally to deport all immigrants, and to take those who will not leave of their own volition and force them into ‘labour camps’. They have scapegoated immigrants as the cause of the financial meltdown, and to a population that is living in times so desperate that children are literally left by their parents to starve to death in the streets, any kind of scapegoat will do. They organize marches down the streets, in which they carry flags bearing this symbol: and they literally use the Nazi hand salute as their political gesture. They are not neo-Nazi look alikes, they are the real deal.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/186-1.jpg" /></p>

      <p class="caption">Golden Dawn’s Flag, Source: Wikipedia</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">The scariest thing is that what was once a small obscure party is now gaining large-scale nationwide support. With 7% of the nationwide popular vote, they received twenty-one seats in May of 2012, which in a second follow-up election was then down-sized to eighteen seats. Literally eighteen ultranationalist, racist Neo-Nazis are now possessing seats in the Greek Parliament--and what is their sentiment like? Well, just for a taste, when a spokesman for one of these parties was in a debate on national Greek television, he literally took a cup of water and splashed it in one female member of parliament’s face, and then slapped across the face another female member of parliament. Also, I’m not sure where to fit this in, and you can make your own decisions on how it applies to the collapse of Greece, but more than half of all police officers in Greece voted for the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, it would of course be foolish to believe that this phenomenon is only occurring in Greece. Radical anti-immigrant ultranationalist parties have been popping up and gaining popularity across Europe. Like I have mentioned before, these sentiments linger deep within a society but are generally overlooked and pushed aside when ‘the times are good’. When the economic trend of stability and prosperity reverses, the certain friendliness evaporates and extremely ugly feelings begin to rise up within the degenerating society. Even in France, easily one of the most socially progressive nations in the world, their extreme right party the ‘Front Nationale’ received 19.5% of the popular vote in April of 2012,<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft39" id="fn39"><sup class="frac">39</sup></a> establishing them as the third most powerful political party in France. We would be far behind the curve to say that ‘there exists the possibility of the emergence of an extreme right, reminiscent of neo-Nazi fascism during these times of economic collapse’. Instead, I would wager to say that as the conditions worsen (which is inevitable for at least many years to come), the conditions that precipitate an emergence of racist sentiments will continue to ripen. When people begin to lose their grips on reality as they become powerless within their own life, it becomes extremely easy to lash out, especially at those weakest in a society. By raising awareness of these tendencies to move towards models of the world built around hatred and by knowing that they could begin to bubble up perhaps even in your own society, an awareness can be created and lived within, which emphasizes companionship and cooperation rather than scapegoating and ostracizing. It is important to keep into context why these collapses are occurring and understand that it is not the fault of the poor or discriminated ethnic groups that have created these conditions. Rather, the focus should be put on the entrenched kleptocracy and the ‘too big to fail’ institutions that have hijacked so-called sovereign democracies with their control of currency and ability to create endless amounts of debt and paper money out of thin air. However, many disempowered will not have the academic footing to be able to realize the true culprits, and I imagine that as opposed to what would be fair, the poor and ethnic groups will continue to be lashed out at by a hurt and angry citizenry.</p>

    <p class="indent">In terms of Canada, we can try and anticipate how collapse will look after it has firmly taken root in this country by simply looking towards cities within our fellow ‘developed’ nations that have already been in this state of collapse for, in some places, up to four years and almost five years now. Studying these places will serve as a roadmap: these are essentially the experimental post-Peak oil, post-economic collapse areas that much of the world will come to look like. At the end of this book there will be listed very good sources of information that can be found on the internet, and several of them look in particular look at the collapse of these once great cities. These sources can be used to keep up to date with where the collapse is <em>right now</em> (in your future reading of this book). In the meantime, let’s examine exactly where these cities currently are, with the final goal in mind of trying to piece together an idea of what collapse will look like when it arrives to stay in Canada.</p>

    <p class="indent">After the huge American crash in the housing market, which was about a 34% ‘correction’ in housing prices, there was of course the associated financial mayhem which also occurred, and is now collectively branded under the umbrella of ‘the financial collapse of 2007/2008’. As has already been detailed in this book, Canada at that point, while it was looking like we were going to join the Americans in their long uphill battle to dig themselves out of a massive debt crater, decided instead to forego the future and just keep digging down deeper. Nonetheless, as the seams of the fabric of society began to fall apart in America, there were certain cities that in particular began to immediately disintegrate. By now, the list has grown to include far too many cities to examine in this section of the book, with more joining the list of literal ‘urban slums’ every day.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, for our particular analysis the best city to examine is the city of Detroit, Michigan. This city has been on a downward spiral ever since the collapse really began in 2007 and has turned into, if crime statistics are any indication, a living hell. Of course, Detroit was once a great hub of culture and industry, donning both the iconic nicknames of ‘Motorcity Detroit’ and ‘Home Of The Motown’. However, in an extremely publicized debacle, the very industries that maintained Detroit were left crippled in 2007 (even after a very Cronyist bailout) and despite politicians’ rhetoric, Detroit is not returning to its economic prosperity of the pre-financial collapse era anytime soon. Of course, these politicians are not looking at economic data and indicators which would point towards a yet another eleven years of hard years of deleveraging for Detroit.</p>

    <p class="indent">With that being said, I could have used a handful of once great urban areas to review for this section: Cleveland Ohio, Camden New Jersey and Gary Indiana specifically come to mind, but Detroit is a painstakingly studied city with a lot of available crime statistics, so it will be Detroit that we look at. However, keep in mind that we are not studying the collapse of a city, we are instead using Detroit as a model for where post-collapse cities are headed. We are studying what North America could look like if this trend of Detroitization continues. I personally believe that Detroit will serve as a model for the future, in both its negative and positive aspects. Even if it seems too alarmist now, or in the long-run it turns out that the crash is not experienced <em>as</em> hard in most places as it has been experienced in Detroit—I think it serves as a very pertinent case study.</p>

    <p class="indent">Firstly, it must be understood that everyone who <em>could</em> leave Detroit, <em>has</em> left Detroit. In the 1960s Detroit was a city of over 2 million (2,000,000) people. Now the population totals only 714,000. There was mass migration out of Detroit beginning with the economic collapse in 2007. I have seen video of people entering homes in mass deserted neighborhoods, finding calendars still open to ‘July 2007’. It is absolutely eerie and downright frightening to see family photos left on the floor, furniture still in place in a decrepit house of which the siding has been completely torn off. It literally looks like a deserted warzone, perhaps abandoned after some sort of nuclear event, but alas this was no nuclear meltdown nor earthquake nor tsunami: this was an economic disaster. I have tried to research where exactly these people have gone, but I have been unable to find any leads or real stories on the subject—the only answer seems to be ‘wherever there was a hope to find a job’.</p>

    <p class="indent">Of course, a ‘job’ is the only modern day way to sustain oneself. This seems to be why literally 53.6% of children in Detroit live in poverty <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft40" id="fn40"><sup class="frac">40</sup></a>, which is the worst in America (but followed closely by Cleveland’s 52.6%). Also, in post-collapse Detroit, 47% of its citizens are functionally illiterate.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft41" id="fn41"><sup class="frac">41</sup></a> This means not being able to do things such as fill out basic forms for job applications, read instructions on prescription pill bottles or understand how to pay bills.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another basic question that is to be asked is: in a collapse, will there be a movement into total police control, or will the city slip out of the hands of law enforcement? In the case of Detroit, and these others cities which are quickly turning into slums, the answer is resoundingly that the control of the city’s streets are falling into the hands of armed gangs. These cities are far too cash-strapped to pay the wages for the amount of police necessary to keep the streets safe and crime free. This I imagine will only be accentuated by the fact that Detroit as a city is now turning off about half of the cities street lights, many of which are already broken and cannot afford to be fixed.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft42" id="fn42"><sup class="frac">42</sup></a> Additionally in Detroit, people are advised to carry a large caliber weapon if they plan to go out alone in the night, and it seems that this defence strategy has been heeded. Within this city, our model of what a post-collapse city may look like in the short term, self defence killings are now 2200% above the American national average, with a 79% year over year increase in justifiable homicide from 2011 to 2012. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft43" id="fn43"><sup class="frac">43</sup></a> I have seen examples from local news in Detroit which paints this picture, where a shop owner was beaten and robbed by a group of marauding thugs, and from that point it took nearly nine hours for the police to arrive. Increasingly now there is ‘citizen law enforcement’, which are volunteers who are armed and help maintain security in Detroit. I have seen in particular these citizen law enforcement ‘officers’ standing, with firearms, outside of churches on Sunday, as without them it was too unsafe to go even to church.</p>

    <p class="indent">To add to the insult, the median home price in Detroit is now only $4000 dollars. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft44" id="fn44"><sup class="frac">44</sup></a> One of the best Canadian financial analysts I have ever had the good grace to come across in my studies, that being Nicole Foss, has done her calculations with models of how the collapse will play out in Canadian real estate, and has pegged her loss of value at 90% in the long term. So whereas a $4000 median home price seems absolutely staggering and truly impossible, especially considering the average Canadian home price is currently sitting at about $380,000. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft45" id="fn45"><sup class="frac">45</sup></a> However, divide that number by 10 and you are left with $38,000—and you begin to see that this is not outside the range of possibility for certain cities or towns.</p>

    <p class="indent">With that being said, it isn’t all negative news that is coming out of this collapsing post-industrial society. We also see emerging what I believe will be, to some degree, a renaissance and a reversion back to the values which were once held in high regard: community, self-reliance, resiliency and family focus, away from careerism and individually focused models of reality. As was mentioned earlier, it is not common within human nature for people to rollover and accept their poor circumstances and I believe that this re-emergence of more traditional values will continue to take root across North America as the current ‘American Dream’ system fails each town, city and community one by one. However, first there is a primal issue that must be discussed.</p>

    <p class="indent">Based on the trends within this book, we are essentially left with two very different outlooks for the future. Firstly, there is the peak-oil, post-economic collapse world of reduced police and municipal government, accelerated crime and poverty and simpler ways of life. This is of course juxtaposed and contrasted with Kurzweil’s technologist view of the future, which is very utopian and speaks of the ability for humans to live forever, in a world of surplus and infinite possibilities. Certainly it would seem they cannot both exist simultaneously. For example Richard Heinberg has made his line in the sand and called for a return to simplicity in life, away from mindless wasteful consumption and to more community based resiliency. Kurzweil has made his prediction of infinite amounts of solar power and the ability to transcend death and live forever with the actions of nanotechnology and a better understanding of how the body functions. It would seem one has to be right, the other has to be wrong, and if they ever debated the issue I am sure they would not shift from their stance. Although Heinberg has analyzed solar power, I have never heard him talk about nanotechnology, and although Kurzweil has called for immense technological transformations, I have never heard him reference debt collapses nor peak oil (although his answer to peak oil would be that solar energy will allow us to make a seamless energy transition).</p>

    <p class="indent">Therefore, if both of these absolutely and inarguably great minds call for very extreme and polar opposite views of the future (Heinberg is calling for reduced complexity in social living, Kurzweil is calling for more complex social organization), then who is right and who is wrong? My answer after considering this in great lengths is that they are both correct. For those living right now with completely bionic limbs, the future is one of greatly increased complexity. However, for those living in poverty in America, relying on foodstamps, which are in many multitudes greater in numbers than those with fully bionic limbs, the story of the future is that of decreased complexity and a return to simpler forms of life. With this in mind, I will describe how these two worlds can exist simultaneously, but the answer is somewhat complicated and I must give a background explanation on the subject.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now one important topic that I have not yet touched on, for completely premeditated and purposeful reasons, are the behind-the-scene human actions that are contributing to peak oil, debt collapses and the rise of Supertechnology. I have tried my best to explain the topics adequately and make the concepts simple enough for anyone to learn and understand, but I have intentionally not touched on the more sinister factors which have led us to where we are today. This is because to do so would require a book in and of itself. The purpose of this particular work was to deliver a crash course in comprehension of these topics, rather than to break down the human motivations and agendas that have delivered us to this point. Having the people understand these trends and be able to prepare for them, at this point, is much more important than being able to pinpoint from where and who these great troubles arose (but believe me, it has been no matter of coincidence that the world looks the way it does today).</p>

    <p class="indent">However, the one factor I cannot leave unanalyzed without this being an incomplete book is the return to an oligopoly or neofeudalism that is taking place across the world right now. There is no shortage of verifiable statistics and data that shows that increasingly the vast majority of the world is being pushed into greater poverty and destitution, while on the backside an extremely slim minority has been running away from the pack by siphoning wealth at an accelerated pace from the middle and working class whilst becoming super rich and super powerful in the process. What it is being created is a return to a system whereby there is ‘nobility’, historically the rich land owners, and below them the peasants or serfs who are completely dependent upon the table scraps of these rich land owners for survival. With this we have seen a creation of a two-tiered world: a two-tiered justice system, and two tiered political system. There is the world of the working and middle class (which the Occupy movement has termed the 99%) and there is the world of the super-rich, where through the manipulation of financial and political systems they are able to use sophisticated methods to literally steal wealth, using this wealth to circumvent any laws or restrictions that were once imposed to offer the unsuspecting public safety from the nefarious practices of the banking sector.</p>

    <p class="indent1">“But there’s a reason. There’s a reason for that. There’s a reason education sucks, and it’s the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. It’s never gonna get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you’ve got. Because the owners of this country don’t want that. I’m talking about the real owners now. The <em>real</em> owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don’t. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they’ve got the judges in their back pocket and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They’ve got you by the balls! They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everyone else.” <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft46" id="fn46"><sup class="frac">46</sup></a> -George Carlin</p>

    <p class="indent1">Mr. Carlin then goes on to explain how they don’t want a population capable of critical thinking, or as George puts it, “they don’t want a population of people who can sit around a table and figure out how badly they’re getting [effed] by a system that threw them overboard thirty [effing] years ago”. But this is the subject for the next book, God willing the opportunity arises.</p>

    <p class="indent">When analyzing the trend of increased social stratification, what it means when applied to the two competing trends of increasing complexity of society due to the power of Supertechnology and decreasing complexity by the way of peak oil and debt collapse is that there will be massive variance in the way the future is experienced. The poor will face food shortages and starvation, while the super-wealthy will be able to reach and surpass biological boundaries we cannot quite imagine at this point. This is of course intrinsically linked with the mass adoption of what was passed off as ‘globalization’, which allowed multinational corporations to consume the resources of entire geological areas and cities, and then abandon the citizenry (and any potential environmental responsibility) by moving its labour base to the obviously cheaper near-slave labor conditions of the ‘developing’ world. This has essentially made those in the working class compete on the labor market with desperate people who would offer their work for fractions of a dollar per hour. This is how corporations, whose entire mandate is simply and only the maximization of profit by all available means, were able to see their profit and power grow to such vast sizes that they rivalled, and indeed were able to co-opt major countries around the world. This of course had initiated a mass self-perpetuating feedback loop whereby this increased purchasing power allowed the corporate state to further infiltrate and co-opt political institutions, allowing the passage of laws and legislation which worked further in their favour.</p>

    <p class="indent">Indeed, there are statistics which can tell the entire story. As history has ‘rhymed’ yet again, we can look back and see that in the 1920s, in the lead up to the collapse which is now called the Great Depression, the circumstances were eerily similar to what was experienced pre-2007 and what is being experienced further yet today. Notably, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the lowest 99% of the population in terms of income to the highest 1% of the population in terms of income. Indeed, it can be easily pictured using this example: during the period of time which the housing boom was occurring in the United States, it seemed like the entire masses were becoming extremely rich. However, as has been analyzed repeatedly in this book, the wealth was a ghostly visage of prosperity, and was truly just an illusion. After nature and reality won the battle yet again against this collectively held delusionary feeling of wealth, it was in fact discovered that the masses were <em>not</em> wealthier but were in fact <em>poorer.</em> However, during all of this time, those within the banking establishment were made extremely rich: CEO bonuses were fattened up, institutions became massive in size and the parasitic industry of banking ballooned to such a size that it engulfed and dwarfed even the real economy.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, this is not a new phenomenon, and all it takes is one look at the data to realize just how cyclical human nature and human history truly is.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/196-1.jpg" /></p>

      <p class="caption"><em>This data speaks for itself.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">This is why when there is an asset bubble in housing, like there currently is to a large degree in Canada, the only two groups of people to truly make gains in terms of wealth (despite the temporary illusions that trick homeowners) are realtors and bankers. It is important however not to bastardize the top 1% of those in the income pyramid based simply on the amount of income they receive.</p>

    <p class="indent">The term 1% obviously blankets that entire subsection of society, many of whom have made their living by producing things that are helpful for society and being a productive member of society—i.e. they have a mutualistic relationship with the rest of the citizenry. Using the 1% as a term is helpful for statistical analysis, and obviously included within that 1% are those who derive their wealth from the banking monopoly, which is an institution which has an extremely parasitic and cancerous relationship with the rest of the society. Indeed, the very term ‘too big to fail’, which is now a colloquial term used to describe firms that are too large to go out of business for fear of systemic failure of the whole monetary system is perfectly reminiscent of a cancer or tumour being too large to excise in an operation without putting the life of the patient in jeopardy. Therefore, analyzing the income of the upper 1% of the population does not synonymously mean analyzing the income of the global banking cartel, which is in fact the parasitic cancer and real driving force behind the Detroitization of North America. Simply by looking at this data we can see that just like in the 1920s, entire nations have been dragged into a massive Ponzi scheme which again has left those at the top extremely wealthy while impoverishing the naive and unassuming rest of the now crippled 99%</p>

    <p class="indent">This is how both Kurzweil’s and Heinberg’s visions of the future can manifest simultaneously. It is possible due to an increasingly stratified world, where the destiny of a sliver of society continues to delineate from the future of the rest of the society. Where most people will face a depression the likes of which has never been seen in mankind’s history, a very small percentage of the population who has made their gains off of impoverishing their fellow countrymen will increasingly be positioning themselves to take advantage of Supertechnologies which may possibly allow them to circumvent the phenomenon of death and old age altogether. Heinberg need not be wrong in his assessment that the world will face difficulties and problems truly unprecedented in human history whilst Kurzweil is correct with his assessment that certain members of society will be able to abandon their traditional bodies and merge with machines, becoming ‘superhuman’ in the process. Those in collapsing cities such as Detroit will never experience the plethora of opportunity afforded by these technologies, unless they are able to come together and piece together the puzzle of what has left them in such a desperate position.</p>

    <p class="indent">This insane stratification cannot be maintained in the light of publicity, and if the recently impoverished citizenry, colloquially termed ‘the 99%’, can coalesce and create the political will necessary to reconfigure society and reduce this alarming slide towards 19<sup class="frac">th</sup> century neofeudalism, then there will not be a return of serfs facing starvation and lords facing immortality, but there will rather be consequences for those who have stolen wealth and impoverished entire nations, in the stead of them retaining this stolen wealth and becoming a new species of human in the process.</p>

    <p class="indent">In conclusion, what we are facing today is the end of an era--an era which was marked by cheap and easily accessible oil, a fiat money system based on debt and an economic mantra of mass consumerism. As has been documented throughout this book, we are facing the limits of our capacity to push this system forward. As the world has been increasingly ‘globalized’, it has become increasingly centralized, based on the availability of a nearly free energy source, that being cheap oil. However, no longer is it economically viable to ship thirty cent products around the world, and have nearly all food produced in a central location and transported unimaginable distances, for days, across the world to be shelved in large supermarkets. The cracks in this systems foundation have already transgressed into major systemic failures and we are truly living on the cusp of yet another complete breakdown. For the 48,000,000 living on government assistance in the United States, and the 100,000,000 in the United States without employment, the system has already long since failed, and they are the casualties. This will continue to occur across the world, with very debilitating and frightening effects, as the world grasps for a new system that is not dependent on perpetual exponential growth and fossil fuels; that is not dependent on mass consumerism of trinkets and irrational desires for pointless products. Those who are not made aware, and therefore are not able to prepare both in the world and in their mind for this massive transition will have an extremely tenuous and difficult decade, but those who are able to anticipate and understand these massive changes will be able to flow with the change. Indeed, as referenced by Charles Darwin, the ability for the adaptation of an organism is what dictates its ability to pass its genetics onto the next generation—and I feel the same principle will apply during these difficult times.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, there is a positive side to this as well. For so long we have modelled in life consumption as the greatest function of happiness, with the philosophy that consumerism and the material possession it affords people is the most palpable way to reach personal fulfillment. In our economic models, we strive for ‘Gross Domestic Product’ as the most significant sign of economic strength, despite the fact that consuming energy contributes to overall GDP, even if it is used for absolutely wasteful purposes. A large GDP is not synonymous with a functioning and fulfilling society, nor is material possession synonymous with a functioning and fulfilling lifestyle—quite the opposite. Despite having adopted to the largest degree the idea of mass consumerism as a means of happiness, the United States is certainly one of the least happy countries on Earth.</p>

    <p class="indent">The feeling of emptiness that people have developed by so long striving to fulfill false realities perpetuated by popular culture in the media has been attempted, unsuccessfully, to be glossed over with antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Communities have been diminished as people cling to their televisions and handheld electronics, virtual communications have replaced to a large degree face to face interactions and despite technology that has ostensibly been adopted to ‘bring people together’, in modern society people are more distanced than ever. Additionally, the total tarnishing of the biosphere on which the human species survives is perhaps the most under examined and overlooked aspect of this entire consumerism based economy. People have, through the corporations they represent in their pathological pursuit of profit, lost the perspective needed to realize that the human species is part of the ecosystem and have in the process lost all connection with the Earth from which we came. If it were up to solely human will to come together and make the fundamental psychological changes necessary to create a system which would better serve the whole of humanity and the ecosystem on which it survives, I would have very little hope that any changes to the system would be made considering how pacified and distracted humanity has become. However, as demonstrated throughout this book, the laws of physics and reality are quickly approaching to force our hand in bringing change to our way of life.</p>

    <p class="indent">Currently economists, politicians and pundits alike are all speaking of an ‘economic recovery’. News comes out about a 0.1% Canadian growth rate in May and there are remarks of it being ‘disappointing’, as if low interest rates should have been all that was needed to kickstart this economy back into the good ol’ days. I believe that the ever increasing amount of people who begin to feel the real crunch of the degradation of our economic system will be the first to realize that a return to the mean of our former way of mass consumerism is simply impossible—the pundits and economists will be the last to admit this. Considering the massive meltdowns occurring in Europe, the huge slowdown in China and the recessionary United States, I believe that it will be generally recognized that we are in a global recession by the summer of 2014. However, I have been absolutely amazed by the ability of those managing these crumbling systems to ‘extend and pretend’, so there exists the real possibility that during this time period the illusion of our fiat currencies and fossil fuel depletions will be upheld, but before long the rude awakening will have certainly taken place and the D word: depression, will be thrown around with ease on a global scale.</p>

    <p class="indent">During these very deflationary global economic trends, I see all commodities falling in value—especially housing (and especially in Canada). However, as these fiat currencies across the world continue to collapse I do not doubt that Helicopter Ben will follow the course that history tells us we will take and begin to fire up the printing presses (as if a secret $16,000,000,000,000 loan isn’t diluting the currency enough already). Once that begins, the effect will be very much like drinking saltwater: it will feel good in the short term to actually have some water intake, but the fact of the nature will remain that we are only further dehydrating ourselves.</p>

    <p class="indent">During this inflation and collapse of fiat currencies, I see gold returning as the true store of value in the world, and reaffirming its place as the world’s reserve currency. For those who are unplugged from the mainstream and familiar with economic history, they will already be moving their wealth into precious metals and will certainly land okay, perhaps even seeing their purchasing power rise during this overflow of paper currencies into the world.</p>

    <p class="indent">For those who are plugged into the mainstream and receive most of their information from the television, they will too at some point look to move their wealth into precious metals, and they will, but as they are literally ‘the herd’, they will lose much of their purchasing power and may even push gold into a bubble. If the value of gold is at some point pushed into a bubble (which has happened repeatedly in history), those who subscribe to the herd mentality and purchase at the peak of its value will (just like housing) face potentially immense losses. I am also of the belief that stocks and other dollar-denominated assets will drop significantly in value. The massive derivatives market which I have referenced in this book, which may possibly be literally 1.5 quadrillion dollars ($1,500,000,000,000,000) in size is a huge ticking time bomb and when it is finally admitted that these are contracts can never be paid, the entire banking system could literally crumble in a matter of weeks. How these insolvent institutions are going to deal with this massive problem is anybody’s speculation: all that is certain is that it will not be pretty.</p>

    <p class="indent">As for my beliefs in terms of fossil fuels: Currently as it stands there are people who believe the idea of peak production of oil is a fraud; these people usually contend that oil is created in an abiotic fashion and has nothing to do with biological organic matter (which gives these hydrocarbons the name of fossil fuels). This was a more vogue point of view several years ago, and I believe that between 2013 and 2014 peak oil will be globally recognized as a true phenomenon. As this realization occurs and begins to enter the mainstream, it will become evident that the days of humans’ reliance on fossil fuels is beginning to wane. Of course, the monoliths who derive their power from the distribution of these fuel sources will continue to enjoy their very centralized power structure, as they push for continued hydraulic fracturing and destruction of the landscape through oil sands extraction. As long as politicians can continue to be purchased by, and therefore stay beholden to the power of these major corporations there will not be political movements towards alternative energy sources.</p>

    <p class="indent">Technology continues to make great strides in both wind and solar energy, and although they supply an absolutely miniscule portion of the world’s total energy demand at this point, there has been an 86% increase (nearly a doubling) in solar power in the last year and a 28% increase in wind.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft47" id="fn47"><sup class="frac">47</sup></a> This points towards an exponential growth in the power derived by solar energy, which as we know can and will be extremely powerful in the medium to long term. However, the story of the world’s need for energy, and its inability to acquire those increasing amounts of energy from the historic means: burning oil, means that in the short term, specifically around ten years, there will in my estimation be a very real energy crunch as the trends surrounding energy-returned-on-energy-invested with oil continue to plummet towards the eventual 1 to 1 endgame.</p>

    <p class="indent">This will cause a plethora of imaginable and unimaginable consequences as our way of life, wholly dependent on oil, comes to an end. The cost of living, in a world already heading for a decade’s long depression will rise significantly. Conventional means of transportation will become even more expensive, and people will have no choice but to be pushed towards public transport and self-powered machines such as bicycles. The rise of bicycling as a mode of transportation is a trend I have a firm belief in, and I have already begun to see this take place. Friends of mine who are very much car aficionados have been asking around on where to find a decent bicycle, and bicycle lanes have already been established quite extensively in cities such as Vancouver and are beginning to pop up throughout Canada.</p>

    <p class="indent">Food production is another major area of concern. Considering there is a very hefty hydrocarbon cost on nearly every piece of food we consume in our current ‘globalized’ system, I see food prices continuing to rise as well, on top of the increased energy and transportation costs. This I believe will lead to more localized food production as people begin to have a collective realization that if they produce their own food they can save themselves lots of money when facing a cash-strapped future. These initiatives have already taken root in cities across the world, as citizens who recognize and understand the realities of peak oil have begun to come together in forming ‘transition towns’, that is communities which are based on self-sufficiency and resiliency. Village Vancouver is one such organization, and although those who participate in Village Vancouver are by today’s standards very ahead of the curve, I believe that increasingly the actions they take will begin to become the norm as the phenomenon of peak oil reaches the consciousness of the mainstream and people are forced, through the various venues of strain that have been mentioned throughout this book, to re-examine the way they live and make changes that will allow themselves to live more frugally.</p>

    <p class="indent">As for Supertechnology: this is certainly the hardest topic to make assertions about because the direction the technology takes will be determined to a large degree by the decisions we reach in the current day, which will of course be multiplied by the chaos factor of how the technology may pull us in ways we cannot quite in this present day anticipate. However, I think warfare will continue to become increasingly mechanized, as remotely controlled machines are able to increasingly replace conventional means of combat, that being sending a flesh and bone human being into a battle zone to have their life threatened. Also in terms of militarization, I believe that cyber attacks such as Stuxnet, which has been successfully used to interrupt systems in Iran’s nuclear facilities, will become more popular and powerful. Nanobots will also begin to be used more effectively for spying and reconnaissance, as we are already beginning to see insect look-a-like robots that are remotely controlled being used by the United States military.</p>

    <p class="indent">For the typical person, they will continue to see their handheld mobile devices increase at rapid paces in terms of power, and also affordability. However, as I have mentioned before, for as long as the rapidly increasing stratification of society continues, I believe that this will be nearly the full extent of the benefits that the majority of the population receives in regards to super computer technology. I do not share Kurzweil’s vision of a utopian future, based on nanotechnology and the escape of death for all. At least in the short to medium term of the next ten years, I believe that the massive trends in debt collapses and fossil fuel depletion will play much greater roles in the lives of most people. I imagine that those living in Detroit in hellish conditions care very little that a chatbot has passed the Turing test if they are having trouble surviving and simply providing themselves with enough food to maintain life.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, for those who can afford the technology, and with the ego sufficient to push themselves to be at the forefront of this new wave, the evidence points towards there being an increasing movement towards humans becoming living cyborgs. That is to say, there will be an increased meshing between robotic, computerized body parts and organic, biological body parts. Robotic limbs and mechanized eyes which can record video are of course only the tip of the iceberg in an exponentially growing trend. The real question begins when someone can afford a robotic limb while having a perfectly functioning limb: will they make the choice to replace their body parts to afford themselves greater speed and power? I think the answer will be a resounding yes, and where that trend begins to take us is currently the domain of science fiction, but is rapidly becoming a reality in our modern day.</p>

    <p class="indent">Based on doing research into the topic of transhumanism, one very startling group of people I have come across are those who have an insane lust for power and strength, with possible psychopathic tendencies. We can already imagine someone who is using anabolic steroids may have a lust for strength, so much so that they artificially crank up their levels of testosterone to change their physique, but what about those who will take it a step further and, with cash in hand, be at the very forefront of this new technology, willing to do whatever it takes to gain an edge on their fellow competitors? These people certainly are not hard to identify, and when listening to them describe their desires for superhuman ability one can’t help but feel a very uneasy sensation. This leads me to feel that if those who can afford upgrading their body from human to robotic remains a minority, and in particular a minority with a feverish lust for power and strength, then I feel there is a very realistic possibility that there will be a creation of ‘superhumans’ so to say, who with increased physical and mental abilities find themselves believing they are a God and posses a God-given right to dominate, overpower and control all other lifeforms and humans on the planet.</p>

    <p class="indent">Thus I believe that it is very important that this quest for power via technological enhancement becomes pushed into the light of the mainstream consciousness, so that there can be wide-held discussions on the topic. Also, this is very important as we are quickly approaching levels of artificial intelligence that can for all extensive purposes and for what we can tell, experience human-like emotions. If we ask a humanoid robot if it is human, and feels love and has a fear of death, and it turns its face into a frown and says “yes, of course!”—then we have a major philosophical hurdle that must be faced. With this, I believe that the ethics of artificial intelligence, although it today may seem like ‘science fiction’, will be a very important topic in the future. Therefore, to create a policy that reflects the sentiments of the broader society, rather than just a minority or elite, then these issues must be brought into the mainstream, in the stead of distraction material that is used by the corporate mainstream to keep people unaware.</p>

    <p class="indent">We are left with is a world that is changing in an exponentially accelerating pace, one of the most powerful mathematic functions to exist. As time itself continues to slow down, more significant things will continue to happen at an ever quickening pace. We currently have an economic system built around a fuel source that is becoming increasing inaccessible, with a concurrent population growth that when graphed appears as a nearly vertical line. As we keep in mind the power of exponential growth as illustrated in our opening chessboard example, we are then able to understand what it means to have an <em>exponentially decreasing</em> trend in terms of oil’s energy return on energy invested, an <em>exponentially increasing</em> amount of debt and fiat currency in existence and an <em>exponentially increasing</em> trend of raw power found in computing technology. Through this analysis we are left with but one conclusion, despite all of the other assertions and speculations about what the future may look like, this one thing is absolutely certain: wide-sweeping and powerful changes are coming to the Earth, the likes of which has literally never been seen before in the history of mankind. These changes will permeate through every facet of our day to day living as our entire models of reality are radically restructured to account for this transformation in the physical environment. There will only be one option left on the table of those who wish to survive and land on their feet in this change: anticipate, and adapt. As we have seen, our lifestyles are wholly unsustainable, and they <em>will</em> be radically altered; our only choice in the matter is whether it is through our own cognition and actions or through painful realizations and having our hand forced by unrelenting realities.</p>

    <p class="indent">The fact of the matter is this: before the new can grow, the old must die. We are living within a man-made economic system based on physical realities which no longer apply in the modern day. We cannot continue tearing up the Earth to create products with no point, and then use debt (i.e. sacrificing the future) to purchase these products. A wide-scaling social experiment of consumerism as a way of self-fulfillment has delivered its verdict and it has been an absolute failure. Mental depressions have spiked in numbers and in ways never seen before, while in our perpetual folly we try to administer psycho-active brain altering chemicals instead of analyzing and fixing the root issues. This endless pursuit of materialism need not end because in and of itself it is destroying the environment on which we survive, nor is it because of a categorical moral imperative—it is because for too long we have forsaken reality, presumed that we were above the laws of nature and assumed that when Mother Nature did return in her reckoning, that we would be able to rely on our seemingly boundless amounts of ingenuity and come up with a timely one-stop fix-all.</p>

    <p class="indent">Considering that we are reaching the end of a system and a way of life, and that before something new can be created the old must die, we therefore have in our immediate midst one very particular problem to deal with, which is the collapse of our archaic system. In a similar fashion to how economic collapse leads to a vacuum of political power that can be filled in with hatred, resentment and barbaric political doctrines, so too can this vacuum created by the death of our old way of life be preyed upon by saboteurs who wish to steer history in their own direction. The resurgence of the extreme-right mentioned in this chapter is just a very sliver of the power grabs and political churnings that have been created during this time. Indeed, we as the author and readers of this book are not the only ones aware of this impending collapse of a way of life and a necessary rebirth of society, this collapse is not only being watched closely by very sinister forces, but it is being led and fuelled by what can only be described as a ruthless conspiracy.</p>

    <p class="indent">There are those of us who are just doing what we can to survive and be happy, which applies for most of humanity at any given point in time. These are the ones among us who have mostly been oblivious to these massive, rapid changes that are occurring, as we have been distracted by the humdrum of day to day living. However, there exists within this same world those who live life outside that norm, those who are attracted to power and seize power by any means. These are the individuals who believe that it is their given right on this planet to achieve their own personal ends by any necessary actions, who are well aware of this collapse and are anticipating it eagerly, creating plans and means by which to capture control when the edifices of civilization begin to break down. Indeed, they have initiated a wide-scoping plan that has been running now for over a decade, and although they seek to remain inconspicuous, if one knows where how to look, like a hunter they can see the tracks left behind and pick up the trail of these enemies of humanity.</p>

    <p class="indent">To expose this plot to the light of publicity, the workings of it, their means and ends is my next goal in writing. The purpose in completing this work that you are now reading was to give a person who has unwittingly been living their day to day life heavily affected by normalcy bias while underestimating the major shifting changes taking place in the world and give that person a crash course in why they need to begin taking an active role in understanding, anticipating and preparing for the future. The truth is that although we choose to entertain ourselves with Hollywood’s celebrities and reality television, the <em>real</em> story of the world is far more engrossing and enticing than anything that could be cooked up within the mind of a single person. The real story, the story of reality and of life on this Earth, has more twists, paradoxes, unbelievable story lines, tragedy and conquer than could ever be written for a Hollywood script. The story of a world in which time itself is slowing down, in which a way of life built on a diminishing resource is ending as simultaneously the world’s largest financial institutions collapse under the weight of their own greed, with the added effect of the emergence of true artificial intelligence—this is a tale that is so endearing it can hardly be met with anything but eager anticipation and extreme excitement. Of course it comes with an added bonus: it is reality and the truth, and this storyline will play out across the remainder of your life.</p>

    <p class="indent">I hope I have done a sufficient job in portraying this story, and making it as real as I possibly could. I strived to create a work that was engaging, informative and educational which all the while captivated your thoughts and attention. In the first four chapters I worked to leave my own personal beliefs out completely and focused on only giving the facts and the theoretical bases necessary to understand the concepts examined. In the final chapter I made my own personal effort at portraying how I think these forces will interact with eachother and play out over the following decade. However, I have only written this book out of necessity. I have written it to be able to act as a shield to those who are facing the threat of massive change, for the readers who have been left completely vulnerable. I have written this book to provide the footholds, in an academic way, for those to be able to maintain their composure as the world changes and make them able to act upon the world, rather than react to the world and be swept away in a sea of change. But as I have just said, this book was written only out of necessity, to immediately supply people with a work that will allow them to begin to prepare themselves for the future. The truth is that this is a story that needs to be told, and told as soon as possible on the widest scale, but this is only half of the coin.</p>

    <p class="indent">I have in this book explained why we cannot rely on oil for much longer—why our financial systems are certain to collapse—and why technological evolution is going to begin to become a major player in shaping the world. But I have not explained why this has come to be, which has been purposeful on my end. I have touched on it briefly but I have not exposed the mechanisms behind it.</p>

    <p class="indent">I am therefore finishing this book not with a sigh of relief, but with a renewed feeling deep inside my stomach which makes my body writhe with adrenaline and energy. The story is not yet finished. There is so much more to be told, the picture has been painted incompletely. Again, this is not by a fault of mine, or a lack of premonition or premeditation—this has simply been a hard fact that I have had to face. This particular story was needed to be crafted and disseminated as a starting basis, and it will allow people to remain astute and aware for the second story that needs to be told: the story of their enslavement.</p>

    <p class="indent">The truth is that the world has been constructed in a very particular way, in a preconceived fashion, by people whose interests are not at all aligned with those of the general population. Most people have the naive belief that the world ‘just sort of turned out this way’—but that is completely wrong. The world has been steered to where it is today, and is continuing to be steered, but now more than ever, in a direction that is completely antithetical to the direction that mankind desperately needs to move.</p>

    <p class="indent">As someone who has dedicated myself to studying, researching, digging deep and intensely learning about these things, I have had to make many sacrifices. I have in particular chosen to live a life far from the average mean of today’s society. I have given up many things that people accept as part of their daily life, because I have deep inside me a burning desire to work for the people who cannot themselves expend the energy to do what I am doing.</p>

    <p class="indent">I understand that most people are simply trying to survive. They are living a life whereby they work and exist, where conspiracies and collapses of economic and energy systems do not come to the fore very often. This, however, does not mean that it is not important nor crucial for them to understand these things, it is rather simply unrealistic to expect that they will have the ability and wherewithal to understand where to get started and from that point have the ability and time to invest in following down the path and expanding their boundaries.</p>

    <p class="indent">That is why I have chosen the life I have. I want to be the person who pushes oneself to look deeper, to ponder the deepest questions, to engage in back in fourth debate with myself about what the truth is and what is a hoax; what is fact and what is fiction. I have chosen to do this because I believe it is my ultimate contribution to this world. I do believe as well that people understand why I do this and appreciate the fact that there is someone who is truly working for their interests, who cares about them and is not looking to double-cross or manipulate them. Someone who holds in high regard the truth, no matter what it is, and strives to reach that ideal of perfect truth in every pursuit they take.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is with this in mind that I make my final words of this book to be a plea. I hope earnestly and sincerely that this book has supplied enough solid ground for someone to stand on, so that they believe that they can face the future with confidence and aptitude. That although they understand the turbulence of the upcoming world, they feel they are bettered and will be able to withstand and prosper within that time. But to protect oneself on a micro scale is enough to save only oneself and one’s family, and only for a limited amount of time. This limited amount of time is I hope enough to prevent an extremely unholy and sinister direction that a certain heinous segment of society is trying to, in a panic and during times of great desperation, push the people towards and have them accept.</p>

    <p class="indent">The truth of the matter is that during this time of collapse and major change, while the world and the general public writhes in the agony of a global debacle, a plan will be unleashed that will steer humanity away from where it yearns to go, away from ecoism and love and understanding, towards hatred, fear and decrepit enslavement.</p>

    <p class="indent">I do not say these words lightly, or to be alarmist. Again, I hold the truth in high regard and would not twist it into something that it need not be. As is the case with the topics in this book, there requires no auxiliary input from the author to turn these topics into something more enticing, exciting or alarming. The stories themselves are all of those things; I am merely a middle man, telling a tale far greater than I could have ever conceived myself.</p>

    <p class="indent">And this is the truth: although it may allow for oneself and one’s family to survive temporarily on a micro scale with the knowledge contained in this particular book, this alone will not be able to save us from the depravity of the larger macro events that will take place during this time, the steering towards further enslavement and oligarchy. It may afford us the time to understand and expose this treacherous plot, and that is all I am hoping for.</p>

    <p class="indent">With this being said, I am hoping to enter into a contract with you the reader. I will from here dedicate myself to a life that most people would probably not choose to enter. I will face the hardest questions, toil over great mysteries and possible double-crossed lies, and will live a life of dedication to honesty and the truth, in the name of emancipating society from the clutches of enslavement and lack of self-determination. With this being said, I ask only in return, for your end of the contract, to please, however possible, spread this information. If that means taking this book and giving it to friends and imploring them to read it, or through sharing videos I will be creating, or even just having conversations with friends, family and neighbors, then please take those actions.</p>

    <p class="indent">The other request is a monetary one. I wish to be employed, not by a corporation or a business, but by the people themselves. To be a champion of the people, paid for and employed by the people. With that being said, I ask that as I make a commitment to learning, organizing and preparing this information in a singular place, you make the commitment to accept me as your employee and purchase this and other books when I am finished. I am not doing this for a profit; I am only accepting cash insofar as it allows me to escape the necessity of raising funds by other means.</p>

    <p class="indent">If it was not for your accepting me as an employee and purchasing my book, I would literally be lifting rocks, working in a position of menial physical labour. I do not ask for much money as I would not hope to impose a financial burden on those I hope to help, and I imagine I will continue to sell my works digitally at ten dollars a piece, which is only two thirds the price of a single mickey of eighty proof liquor. I ask that the reader, if they so choose to drink (which they may not choose to do after my second book!) that only once they choose to forego a mickey and instead act as an employer of mine, by providing the assistance necessary that will allow me to continue this life I have chosen to pursue as part of my destiny. I do not work through any publisher, so this money will not be entering the hands of anyone except myself to cover the costs of distributing the books themselves—none of your money will be landing in the hands of a bureaucratic institution.</p>

    <p class="indent">With that said, I would hope that you accept my offer of a contract, to enter in a commitment with me whereby you will purchase my work and support me as I make my commitment to you to live a life of sacrifice and trying to put together the puzzle pieces of the world. Spreading the word of my work, digging into it yourself and perhaps becoming part of it yourself are all things that can be small efforts but have great effect.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the end, if we work together and I can focus my efforts on this line of work and not have to worry about leaving this behind to work selling my labour to a business or corporation, then I will be eternally grateful and will accept that as yet further motivation and encouragement to continue my dedication to the truth and the expanding of consciousness for the whole of humanity. With that being said, I wish to thank you for riding out a book which I am sure could be somewhat harrowing and difficult to face at times, for persevering and making a dedication to the truth and to the future of our world. I thank you deeply and hope that this is looked back on as a starting point for something which grew to be extremely powerful and uplifting. Thank you.</p>
