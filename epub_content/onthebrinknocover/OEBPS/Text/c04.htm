    <p class="indent">It is typical today to draw comparisons between the Great Depression of the 1930s and the so-called ‘Great Recession’ which began roughly at the start of 2008. There are certainly parallels: they were both created by the explosion of an asset bubble and have both wrought tremendous financial destruction on a global scale. With a casual outside observation this would seem to be sufficient for a side by side comparison. However, when we dig deeper and are able to break outside of the mainstream narrative that has been created for us, we uncover a problem much larger, much more systemic and much more dangerous than was even the Great Depression--which until this point has been the greatest financial collapse in history.</p>

    <p class="indent">Our ‘Great Recession’, that being the financial collapse of the late 2000s, was, according to the mainstream pundits, born solely out of the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States. However, what has been written in the history books as the precipitating factor of this economic collapse (mortgage owners defaulting on their payments) is simply the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This view cries desperately to be debunked, and that is exactly what will be done in the following pages. It is not hard to prove, considering there is a wealth of data to draw upon, that there were economic factors at work causing this collapse that far exceed the scope and magnitude of a housing bubble in the United States.</p>

    <p class="indent">Today we continue to hear about the ‘recovery’ from our latest depression, with politicians pointing towards recovered jobs, growth in GDP and other statistics we will find to be mostly irrelevant. We all know statistics can be massaged to the point where they will tell you whatever you want to hear, and to a dishevelled and frightened populace, sitting on the brink of an economic collapse, what the people want to hear right now is that things are looking up (and the politicians will gladly assist them in projecting that unreality). Sadly, the idea of a recovery is only found in the domain of wishful thinking, and neither in hard economic data nor current trends can we see anything that would appear to be a recovery. What we are seeing is an economic system that was created for a past reality and is falling apart at the seams. But before we delve deep into the mechanics of our deteriorating system, let’s get our feet on the ground with some simple concepts.</p>

    <p class="indent">Throughout history, going back thousands of years, we can see a basic pattern emerge which personifies economic crashes. The pattern is as such: a group of assets (company shares, houses, even at one point tulips) rise in <em>price</em> at a speed which far outpaces real value (reality). This leads to such crazy events as people actually spending huge sums of money on things as trivial as tulips (it was a sign of wealth—go figure). However, when people finally begin to realize exactly what they’ve gotten themselves into, the sentiment which fuelled the huge upward swing in price reverses, and reality comes back with a vengeance. This is followed by the rapid depreciation (fall in value) of that asset. This stage is what would then be called a collapse or correction, depending on the severity of the losses. This is succeeded by a very harsh economic period of time (depression, recession) and then eventually, when the markets stabilize again, we have a recovery (return to the norm).</p>

    <p class="indent">Even though it was the largest and most powerful economic crash the world had ever seen, the Great Depression is not what is sitting on our collective plates right now. With the Great Depression there was an eventual return to the mean. In no hyperbolic terms, we would certainly be in a better situation if we were faced with the Great Depression today. What we are facing now is a much more sinister scenario.</p>

    <p class="indent">This recent economic disaster, the implosion of the financial world from 2007 to 2008, has all the familiar signs of a great depression except for one factor: the recovery. There since 2008 has been <em>no economic recovery</em>.</p>

      <p class="caption"><em>“Recovery means return to the mean. What do</em> <strong><em>you</em></strong> <em>see?”</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">Pundits like to point at certain statistics, job growth in a particular sector or rising prices of shares in companies such as Apple or Google—whatever they can find to point to and say “ah, here it is, the recovery!” Although this ignoring of the larger picture can produce sound bites which politicians and the mainstream media both thrive on, they ignore and even mock the true gravity of the situation. To the one hundred million (100,000,000) without employment in the United States, they know all too well the depth of the situation.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="indent">The truth of the matter is that we are living in a world in which the economic system is antiquated and will no longer work with our physical reality. We hear politicians daily speak in terms of growth when referencing the economy. “We grew at 2% this year” or “we are keeping interest rates low to try and grow the economy as much as possible”. What is never mentioned, or at least understood, is that this perpetual growth is in fact an exponential equation. Like was mentioned earlier, if an economy grows at 3% a year (considered a snail’s pace), it takes only 23 years for that economy to <em>double</em> in total size. After that point, it takes only 13 years for another 100% increase to occur. What we have is a chessboard of doublings that is very foreign to comprehension of the human mind: we are not wired to understand this kind of growth. Yet is the very foundation upon which our economy is constructed. If an economy ceases to grow, it is felt in terms of pain for the middle and lower classes: jobs are lost, savings are wiped out and homes are foreclosed upon. For our economy to run even relatively smoothly it requires <em>perpetual growth</em>.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is because we have an entire economic system built on one commandeering principle: debt. In our current system, debt is money and money is debt. Most people simply have no idea how our banking system works. We think, intuitively and naively, that when we go to the bank and take out money, that bank is taking physical cash from someone else’s stash, a deposit on hand, and giving it to you to spend. Thus we would believe, they can only lend out as much money as they have deposits on location. This is incredibly wrong. To believe this exemplifies total ignorance of a topic which will only become more relevant as the world’s financial woes are yet again pushed to the top of the news hour. However, this lack of understanding is not the fault of the masses in most cases—it is simply a topic that is seldom spoken about. The purpose of this chapter then, is to allow you to slap the book shut after a thorough read and from that point on be able to understand how our economic system works: and exactly why it is mathematically certain to cease working—sooner than we might imagine.</p>

    <p class="indent">Marc Faber, a very famous economist who had correctly predicted the United States’ economic collapse and the Euro-zone crisis years in advance, when asked when the financial system is going to finally implode, has a very coy answer, one which I will steal from him to drive home this point. When asked when the day of reckoning is going to come, his answer is that “everyday, we are one day closer”. This is because it is absolutely impossible to nail exactly <em>when</em> it will happen, with the world being as complex and volatile as it is. Considering all the global, vested interests trying to steer the outcome, you never know what will be the trigger--the straw that breaks the camel’s back. All that we know is that, very simply, as economic analyst Chris Martenson has said “using a dollar store calculator and writing on a napkin” we can prove that we are continuing to pile on debt throughout the Western world at an <em>exponentially</em> accelerating pace, which leaves us with infinite amounts of debt and with only a finite world to conjure up the resources and money (we could just print the debt to pay it off—but we will get to why this would be a disaster in its own right). This exponential debt growth cannot be sustained in the long run and it is hardly being held together on a day to day basis. However, knowing the ultimate date of our reckoning with reality is of little importance. Knowing with certainty that the date is coming, being able to understand why and expressing it to others is, on the contrary, of paramount importance.</p>

    <p class="indent">Quite simply, the reason we know that the financial system is going to have a complete collapse is because, like was mentioned earlier, in today’s world debt is money and money is debt. In our current system, the total amount of debt is growing at an exponential rate, peppered along by the force of compound interest (which is of course, exponential itself). Chris Martenson, when fitting an exponential curve on a chart of ‘total credit expansion in the United States’, which includes federal debt, state debt, city debt, corporate debt and consumer (personal) debt, found that there was a 98.9% correlation between a simple exponential curve and the curve of credit expansion in the United States. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft17" id="fn17"><sup class="frac">17</sup></a> This evidence proves a very important point: that the amount debt in the world is exploding, not at a linear rate like we humans intuitively understand, but at a rate which grows upon itself like in the fable mentioned earlier in the book.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/ding.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">It would be theoretically possible to sustain an exponential growth in the amount of debt (money that has to be paid back in the future) if, and only if there existed simultaneously the spectre of constant exponential economic growth. Within an environment of constant and parallel economic growth, there remains the possibility to ‘dig yourself out’ of larger and larger debts. This can be easily imagined on a personal scale. If we have a personal debt that is growing exponentially but we also have a wage that is growing exponentially, then we would be living within a system that could conceptually go on forever. However, this quickly changes when the debt continues to grow exponentially while growth in income ceases to exist. In that scenario, with a rapidly accelerating debt and a stagnant wage, the whole system comes to a halt. On a personal level, it means the person must eventually face the fact that they will not be able to pay what is still an exponentially accelerating debt and they are forced to face a painful default and declare bankruptcy. However, this is when only examining this scenario of stagnant incomes and exponentially growing debts on a personal level. When we look at it at a global scale, it means that the system itself must go through the painful realization that it will never be able to pay back its debt, and the entire financial system, including every nation within it, must face a painful default and declare bankruptcy—which is essentially admitting that the system has failed and must be started anew.</p>

    <p class="indent">The truth is that there was once an era where ‘economic growth’ was synonymous with oil extraction—the more oil pumped out of a country’s landscape, the more economic growth was made possible. That is why I had chosen to analyze oil depletion in the first chapter of the book before heading into the associated economics. As we have already seen in the first chapter, this era of endless and magnificent returns on oil extraction is approaching its end, yet we still live within an economic system that was created for exactly that: endless, perpetual, exponential growth. We have what amounts to an old dinosaur financial system, which tells us that infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is possible. It tells us that the larger our gross domestic product—or in other words consumption—the better. The more consumption the better; even if it is illogical, even if it destroys the planet we rely on for survival. In this world, having a poorly insulated house is good for business because it means you consume more energy. In this world, increasing debt at an exponential rate is just dandy, because you will always be able to pump out more oil to cover your expenses. This view of the world is coming to a close—at an alarming rate. This is why I have chosen the title of the book as such: we are truly on the brink of watching this whole paradigm collapse.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, taking my word for it is one thing, and although I have no agenda to push on you and thus no incentive to lie (and am therefore relatively trustworthy especially when compared to corporate outlets), simply trusting my word will not be good enough. It will not suffice to say, when explaining to others why we are on the brink of some truly world-shattering events, “well, because some author said so in a book”. To understand firstly why the system will collapse, you have to understand the mechanics of the system—and that is exactly what the next few pages will cover. After reading this chapter you should be able to understand with clarity why it is a mathematical certainty that our economic paradigm is destined to fall apart at the seams.</p>

    <p class="indent">To understand this, we really have to understand that money <em>doesn’t exist</em>. This is a concept that most people have trouble grasping initially, but it is absolutely crucial to be able to wrap your head around. Again, the idea that banks have deposits that they lend out, and they cannot lend out more than they have on hand is so far from reality that I really fear for the future of anyone who believes this to be the case. Like I have alluded to earlier, in our current financial system nearly all money is simply debt, estimates of Nicole Foss place credit as 95% of the money supply. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft18" id="fn18"><sup class="frac">18</sup></a> Or, to put it another way, if you were to examine all the money floating throughout the ‘Western’ economies right now, you would find that the large majority is simply credit (as opposed to being real currency, the thing that we can put our hands on). It is mostly all numbers stored in computers as debt, credit—or put another way—simply a bunch of IOUs.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, if you ask the average person what money is, they will most likely motion towards a $5 bill, or some change in their pocket—this is just meat and potatoes currency which makes up our supply of base money. These people would be technically right, but are missing the much bigger part of the story. To leave it at that will simply not do, especially if we are trying to use our knowledge to navigate what will arguably be the greatest single event in human history (that is, the collapse of the US Dollar). If you want to be able to elude the financial crashes that have been laid out on the track before us, you are going to need a much stronger grasp of what money today really is. The first term that is of absolute importance to understand is <em>fiat currency</em>. If the world was just, and information was not withheld, and citizens at large were not given the mushroom treatment (kept in the dark and fed feces), then fiat currency would be a term known by each and every person on Earth. Sadly, it is somewhat specialized knowledge these days. But nonetheless, let’s dive right into it.</p>

    <p class="indent">A normal currency is anything which is a measure of value and allows for the exchange of goods within a society. We think of this as Bank of Canada notes (Canadian bills), or Federal Reserve notes (American bills), but you can be creative with this. Historically, things such as cigarettes, seashells, gold coins—even sticks have all symbolized ‘money’ and have thus been currencies in the past. A <em>fiat</em> currency, however, is a very important and particular term. A fiat currency is any currency, or measure of value, in which the value of that currency is decreed upon it by a figure of authority, usually a government. This currency has <em>no value</em> except that value which is <em>‘wished’</em> upon it by the government.</p>

    <p class="indent">Let us be clear that there is <em>nothing</em> of value in a $100 bill (other than maybe its possible heat energy). It is merely a piece of paper. If we had a boat full of $100 bills and it capsized in the ocean, if we were to 50 years later rediscover that lost money chances are the bills would be absolutely worthless, even if they were found to be in perfect condition. I say that it is likely because the average lifespan of a fiat currency is only 41 years. At this point, they would have absolutely no value; you could not use them in a barter exchange. Let me stress this again: the only value that fiat currency has is that it was declared by some figure of power to have value. There is no productive capacity, no intrinsic value, nor is it a measure of past labour. Natural market forces did not decide that the currency held in our wallets has value. Someone just points at it, declares it money and “vuala!”, you can now barter with it and exchange that simple piece of paper for tangible items vital to the survival of humans, such as water and bread. If you see where this is headed, then you’re on the right track, and yes—it does happen. If you don’t see where this is headed then just wait, we are getting there.</p>

    <p class="indent">Currently, we live within a completely fiat currency system in the United States, Canada, and across the world. Indeed, the United States dollar, what is called a Federal Reserve Note, or a greenback, was once pegged to the value of gold. In that system you could take your hard-earned cash and exchange it directly for gold something which has always been valuable in barter exchanges. For reasons we have already discovered, namely the peaking of domestic US oil production and the knock-on effect this had throughout the economy, but also due to financial needs surrounding the invasion of Vietnam, then President Richard Nixon was forced into removing the greenback from its peg to gold. This, as we will discover, had <em>immense</em> implications on the financial system across the world and at the time was called the Nixon Shock. What it effectively did was remove the last remnants of honesty within finance. Whereas gold could not be summoned up with the flick of a pen, or created out of keyboard punches, this now purely fiat currency could be whisked out of thin air on computers, could be printed at any extent for whatever reason and could be simply produced again and again, over and over out of thin air.</p>

    <p class="indent">If you or I were to fire up a printer and make a bunch of $100 bills, it would be counterfeiting and we would (if we were caught) most likely be sent to prison. It is a very serious offence, for obvious reasons. However, central bankers are allowed to counterfeit legally. And when you do a bit of background research and find that most heads of central banks across the world are former employees of the notoriously dirty Goldman Sachs bank (including Canada’s own Mark Carney) you begin to wonder: why have we put the ability to print money out of thin air in the hands of verified, bonafide, bankster criminals? Well, that is another story for another time; we must stay on topic. However, that is a story that needs to be told, and I would love to tell it. But in the meantime, we need to get people understanding how the system works, before we can get people understanding how criminal bankers across the world have captured significant positions in this faltering system. And on that note, onward!</p>

    <p class="indent">What this purely fiat system has done is opened the door of possibility for the things most people understand are drastically improper or wrong, but they simply scratch their head when they try to understand how it is possible. Things like, how is the United States federal government 17 trillion dollars in debt, yet continuing to pursue a foreign policy based on militaristic domination? How did the Federal Reserve loan over 16 trillion dollars in secret to corporations and banks around the world in 2008? I’ll tell you one thing: they definitely didn’t mine 16 trillion dollars worth of gold and then transport it to these banks and corporations. In what we will find to have extremely sinister consequences, this insane transfer of wealth from those who pay taxes in the United States, to different banks all across the world, was done with the use of a computer. The money did not exist, as is the case with most of our money, anywhere except in the mind of a machine.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="indent">When I was beginning to wipe the cobwebs off my eyes, but before I had dashed headlong into a world of unravelling the mysteries of money, governments and resource depletion, I had heard people interviewed at Occupy movements around the world talking about something they called fractional reserve banking. It was contended, rather adamantly by those being interviewed that whenever a bank received a deposit of, let’s say $100 dollars, the bank would then be able to lend not only the original $100, but an extra $900 along with it. The $100 deposit was all the collateral that was needed to then go on and lend an extra 900% of its value. I myself remained sceptical.</p>

    <p class="indent">“There’s no way”, I thought. “This person must have some bad information. There is a bit more honesty in banking practices than that—that would mean the whole system is completely unstable. In fact, the idea itself is even somewhat ridiculous. Besides, even if that is the case in some places, there’s no way that could happen in Canada”.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is true that the idea of lending upwards of 10 times the amount of the original collateral is absolutely ridiculous, that it is completely unstable, and to boot, dishonest. However, I am here to affirm to you that that it is in fact that basis upon which our financial system works. Sadly, it is hardly the full extent of how dishonest our banking practices are, in fact, it is not even the worst idea nor the practice which has left banks most vulnerable to collapse. I am sure we can all see what the issue in lending out 10 times the collateral is, namely that if $100 is lent to 10 different people on the back of a single $100 deposit—what happens when the original person comes back asking for their deposit? Now what collateral stands for those ten people each walking around with $100? (A: There is no collateral)</p>

    <p class="indent">I used to wonder when I started really exploring this information as to whether or not the US dollar could survive; whether or not the Canadian banking systems could survive. I would bargain with myself, weighing possibilities against each other and trying to come up with a percentage probability in which I thought the dollar would collapse and this fiat, debt-fuelled Ponzi-scheme would come crashing down. However, now I can tell you with <em>absolute certainty</em> that it will collapse. And the only way I can be so sure of this is because of the certainty of mathematics. As we have seen in the opening of this book, exponential growth is such that once you start getting into the deep end (past the knee of the curve), you really, really start getting into the deep end. Once that curves starts to bend and projects you straight up into the air like a rocket, there is no more turning back, slowing down or turning the engine off. All you can do at that point is hold on tight. This is what is what is happening across the world. People are holding their breath as we zip into completely uncharted territory—that being a totally interconnected economic system crumbling in front of our very eyes. Everyone is feeling the repercussions of this, yet the mechanics behind it (in my experience) are understood by very few.</p>

    <p class="indent">With that being said, there is one very important piece of information to understand that will automatically separate you from the masses of people who are sitting on the sidelines, trying to comprehend this financial drama, and that is that <em>there is absolutely no growth scenario which will account for all the debts incurred on the world’s financial systems.</em> Every Western country is in over their head in debt, which is not only ballooning out of control but also collecting interest. What we are left with is a situation in which not only is the amount necessary to be paid back exploding, but the interest payments to be paid back on it are exploding as well. The whole thing is a self-perpetuating feedback loop, based on compound interest--the same compound interest Albert Einstein likened to be the most powerful form of exponential growth known to man. Likewise is the case in nature, and as we are going to find out in a minute, anything that exists in a self-perpetuating feedback loop is bound to collapse.</p>

    <p class="indent">We can think of this in terms of a thermostat: if we have a thermostat that will, upon feeling it is too cold in a room, turn on the heat and then turn off that heat when the temperature reaches a certain comfortable point, then we are in a self-balancing feedback loop and the system is stable and can be maintained. If we have a thermostat that, upon feeling it is too hot in a room, cranks the heat up, and then feeling that heat continues to crank the heat up even further, then we are in a room in which the feedback loop is self-perpetuating with a system that is wholly unstable and cannot be maintained. That is exactly what we are in across the world right now: a boiling room that upon feeling that it is too hot (that these countries cannot repay their debt) are using already bankrupted nations and banking institutions to further bailout other bankrupted nations and banking institutions. It <em>cannot</em> be maintained, it is <em>certain</em> to collapse, and to leave a lot of people crippled in its wake (which we will be examining as well at a later point).</p>

    <p class="indent">This is why it is truly disheartening for me to see these economists and heads of financial institutions look at economic data and use phrases such as “surprisingly disappointing” to explain the state of their country’s economies. It is particularly startling because the very people put in charge of ‘fixing’ the economy and making sure the outlook for the average citizen improves will simply not tell the people the truth. It is, to those of us who keep a close eye on financial and political events, extremely harrowing to see these people, be it Mark Carney and Jim Flaherty of Canada, or Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner of the United States, get on television and look into the television cameras (just like Richard Cheney with his deceitful New York Times leak) and say “there has been modest growth, but there has been growth nonetheless, and we expect that things will turn around. Before long we will be back to prosperity”</p>

    <p class="indent">These kinds of statements lead to a disagreement that arises between people who are study economics and spend their time trying to stay on top of financial news. The disagreement is over whether or not these people in government and at the head of large financial institutions know wholeheartedly they are lying when they speak to the general public, or are instead just simply incompetent, indoctrinated by neoliberal Keynesian schools of thought.</p>

    <p class="indent">The first train of thought is that these actors are frontmen of a criminal elite that knowingly keep the people in the dark about the true state of the world to maintain the status quo. With the maintenance of the status quo they can cling to the positions of power they have reached within that current system. Obviously, this is the darker supposition and a much more sinister conclusion to reach. As someone who has personally experienced economic indoctrination at the hand of my university, I can say there definitely exists the possibility that these people are just preaching a failed religion, but it’s hard to be sure.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is nearly impossible to prove with only circumstantial evidence one over the other, but in the grand scheme of things it is of little importance, especially for the analysis that we are trying to conduct. This is because what is easily agreed upon, between those of us who spend much of their time poring over news from around the world, is that the public is wholly undereducated and being fed terrible information, leaving them extremely vulnerable to being overwhelmed by collapsing financial systems in the process (do a YouTube search for Great Depression to see exactly what I mean). What is understood and is in consensus is that the public needs to be woken up and brought up to speed in a hurry—which is why I am sitting here pounding these keys with a certain hastened tenacity.</p>

    <p class="indent">But first it’s…</p>

    <p class="sec1"><span class="underline">Time For A Thought Experiment!</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Let’s say that you, as a free and autonomous soul, take $100 dollars and deposit it in a bank of your choosing. With the magic of fractional reserve banking you have just awarded that bank between $1000 and $2000 dollars that can then be lent to other people—with interest. The $1000 to $2000 range is based on reserve requirements; if the requirement is 10% then that bank is able to lend $1000, if it is 5% they are able to lend $2000. In the United States the reserve requirement is between zero and ten percent, depending on the size of the institution. In Canada, since 1992, there have been no reserve requirements whatsoever. (Just for the sake of juxtaposition, China’s current reserve requirement is 20.5%)</p>

    <p class="indent">This process of borrowing larger amounts of money with only a small amount of actual principal (collateral) is called leveraging. Leverage is a financial tool that can be used by those looking to make extra cash with a small amount of initial investment. What leverage essentially does is increase the risk of a financial bet, but also the reward. Consider this real-world scenario to understand the implications of using leverage to make money, and keep in mind that when a bank lends out ten times their collateral, they are simply leveraging themselves. Now, let’s peer into our crystal ball and see if we can learn a lesson or two about leverage:</p>

    <p class="indent">Its magically 2006 and we are watching an ambitious young soul, looking to flip a property and make a bunch of money off of the booming United States housing market. He walks into his bank with $20,000 in his pocket, looking to purchase a home in an area in which the prices have been following a skyrocketing trend. The bank gives him the OK for a mortgage and loans him $200,000 based on his $20,000 (which we would call his principal). This person is therefore leveraged 10:1, that is, he has borrowed ten times the value of his initial investment. Now imagine this: the price of the home of which this person purchased, which was originally $220,000 continues to climb. Based on other debt fuelled purchases (which we will examine in detail in a bit), the price of the home now rises to $240,000. So, the home has increased in price by $20,000.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, if our friend were to cash out at this very instant, he would sell his home for $240,000, pay the bank back the loaned $200,000 and have $40,000 sitting in his pocket. He would have doubled his money in the blink of an eye. With only $20,000 he was able to take a leveraged position which paid out a huge sum, a 100% return in finance is really astounding. This would be an example of using leverage and getting a big reward. Now, that is fine and dandy, and I’m sure that happened to many people who were in the United States housing market looking to profit. However, leverage is one of the premier examples in the world of a double edged sword. If you are absolutely certain the asset (in this case the house) that you are going to purchase is only ever going to go up in value, which is what most Americans foolishly believed at the time, then taking a leveraged position is literally a good bet. However, let’s look at the scenario that was ultimately the Achilles heel of not only millions of people across the United States, but what set off a chain reaction which almost saw most, if not all of the major US banks go underwater and require taxpayer bailouts to survive.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now: same person, same mortgage, same house--except this time, after his $200,000 loan with $20,000 down, the price of his $220,000 house decreases. Let’s say it’s a modest decrease in value, only 10%. The house falls $22,000 in price, to $198,000. Now if our friend, let’s call him Fred just to make him a little more real (as real as someone named Fred could be)—now Fred decides that this housing market is only going to continue going downhill and that he better cash out while he still can. He is thankfully able to sell his house for $198,000, but when he goes to pay back the bank he realizes something: not only did his original $20,000 evaporate into thin air (perhaps that was all the money he ever had to his name) but now he is actually $2000 in the hole. He has no choice but <em>to declare bankruptcy.</em></p>

    <p class="indent">Now this was with a modest price reduction, in a very, very modest thought experiment. If we play around a little bit with the variables, we can come up with some very ugly scenarios, scenarios which were not a rare occurrence in the United States from 2007-2009, but were rather the norm. Let’s play around with the numbers a bit.</p>

    <p class="indent">In this example Fred’s purchased home cost him an initial $400,000 but fell in price by 70%, which was not uncommon in 2007 and 2008 (median home price in Detroit as of July 2013: $4000). That house would have lost $280,000 in value. Fred, if he had only put down his initial investment of $20,000, would be <em>$260,000 in the hole</em>. The scenarios can be extremely, extremely ugly.</p>

    <p class="indent">This is the nature of a leveraged investment—you can make large profits off of a small amount of initial principal, but the flip side is very dangerous. In just a small amount of market fluctuation, your entire investment, which in some people’s case are most of their life savings, can be evaporated in literally just a handful of months. In a leveraged position that sees the asset fall in price, 100% of that loss in value is coming directly from <em>your</em> investment (not the bank’s). This has huge implications for people who have been working their entire life to pay off their mortgage. If the fall in price is $200,000 and throughout that person’s life they have paid a total of $200,000 into their mortgage, they have lost all their money and start over at $0. We have already seen this happen across the United States: when the housing markets begin to tumble and fall rapidly in prices, years and decades of hard work simply disappear.</p>

    <p class="indent">As it stands, the most common form of leveraged buying is through mortgages. Like in the United States in 2008, and is currently happening in Canada in 2012, when people see their asset’s price rising (in this case their house), although they are leveraged to the hilts and under an insane ratio of actual amount invested to amount owed, they do not think of the consequences of what will happen if and when that asset value starts to go the other way. A collectively held false belief that housing prices will only rise only accentuates the problem. This is also exasperated by the near 0% interest rates being centrally controlled by the Bank Of Canada. People are encouraged to live in debt and now they are swimming in it with no foreseeable way out. This is also true for many countries around the world, as to prop itself up in its dying stages, the current economic paradigm is spitting out debt, desperately creating more fiat currency to try and paper over the problems. The United States is trillions in debt, but as Alan Greenspan, (who need I remind you was considered the most powerful man in the world when he headed the Federal Reserve) has admitted “The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print more money”. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft20" id="fn20"><sup class="frac">20</sup></a></p>

    <p class="indent">What Greenspan’s words indicate is something that should certainly be understood by any person who holds any amount of paper currency. It is not without consequence that the Federal Reserve is able to print any conceivable amount of currency it wants to pay off its debts. This strategy of just merely increasing the total amount of money to pay ballooning debts has serious effects. Just ask those living in Zimbabwe in 2007, who one year could purchase bread with a $1 bill, and the next year could not purchase bread with a one hundred trillion ($100,000,000,000,000) dollar bill.</p>

    <p class="indent">To understand the full picture of how money is created before we look into the consequences of such actions, let’s bring it back to the bank scenario. Now, you walk into your bank and deposit $100. Rather than take that $100 and loan it to someone else, that bank saves your $100 as collateral and lends out $1000, which it creates out of thin air and stores on its computer. Another person deposits $100, and again the bank loans $1000. Each time that bank is loaning that cash with interest, and raking in huge profits. With only an inkling of your original currency, the bank has whipped many times the original amount into existence from thin air and lent it out to anyone who would come by, willing to take on more ‘credit’. The bank holds onto this ‘fraction’ of the reserve and will peddle the rest as debt to whoever may come by looking to owe money. This is one way in which money is spontaneously made.</p>

    <p class="indent">Another way currency is whipped out of thin air is through credit. Now, if I were to make a purchase with a credit card, say I went to <a href="http://onthebrinkbook.com">OnTheBrinkBook.Com</a> and bought a copy of ‘On The Brink’, then there would be a $10.00 charge to my credit card. PayPal is looking at the payment, and their machines cannot for all intensive purposes tell the difference between that $10 or another $10 someone else paid by cash. To them, it is all the same. Now, one has to wonder—where did that credit card payment just come from? Did the bank in question really just take 10 of their dollars and hand it over to PayPal? The answer is no. That $10, through the magic of credit, was whisked into creation, again: by a bank. That $10 doesn’t exist in this world, except on a computer screen, with an IOU attached on YOUR balance sheet which says “this sucker will fork up the money”. Say you didn’t pay that $10—then it was magically created out of thin air, purchased something in the real world, but never really existed. Let’s say 100 people did the exact same thing. Let’s say 1000 people did the exact same thing, except with $100,000 purchases. Let’s say the Federal Reserve did that with $17,000,000,000,000 (17 trillion) without even telling anyone. Would it matter? What would the implications be?</p>

    <p class="indent">Each time something is bought on credit, it amounts to an expansion of the money supply. The IOU is to be paid at a later date, and the amount of money in circulation increases. This is not without consequence, however—there are real and drastic consequences to be paid each time this happens. The term to be understood here is <em>inflation</em>. Inflation has many implications, but the actual meaning itself couldn’t be easier to understand. Inflation simply follows the law of supply and demand. We know that when there is more of something, it is worth less. The same thing applies to currency—the more Bank of Canada or Federal Reserve Notes floating in circulation, the less they are worth, or in more pragmatic terms—the less can be received in exchange for them. They lose value.</p>

    <p class="indent">Inflation is a very sinister phenomenon. Most people do not understand that if they receive a pay raise of 5%, but the inflation of their money is 6%, that they are actually <em>losing</em> purchasing power. Knowing that alone will set someone apart in terms of understanding economics from the general population. What it boils down to is this: every time a bank whips up currency out of thin air, or a government does the same thing to prop up a failing bank—value is being chipped away out of your hard earned cash.</p>

    <p class="indent">The economic purpose of this book is to uncover the reasons behind the financial ruin that has been set in motion across the world stage. Those of us in Canada are playing catch-up to the financial collapse seen below the border in the United States—what this ultimately means is that like with our analysis of peak oil production, we are able to use the pain and anguish of our brothers and sisters South of the border to paint scenarios for what Canadians may likely face in the coming years. As with peak oil production, we will not be eluding this great financial tsunami, but rather will be delayed in our experience to the downside.</p>

    <p class="indent">With that being said, it leaves open a great window of opportunity for Canadians to analyze and examine what is happening south of their border. This will allow those living in Canada and many other nations the time needed to make prudent decisions that will hedge them against future hardships. Considering the great pain and anguish that has been, and continues to be experienced in developed nations across the world, it would be all but absolutely insane for us as Canadians to not seek to learn what we can from the experience of these countries and search through all possible venues the ability to avoid it. It would be a crazed action to partake in, but indeed the path that we are following as a country is the exact path that was taken by United States. The best term I have seen used to describe this is a “March To The Cliff” which was a phrase used by Frontline PBS during their examination of the lead up to the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market in the US. A steady and unrelenting march to the cliff is exactly what the Canadian market is doing as this book is being read. That is, unless we’ve already jumped off.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/ding.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">A news story that had come out and caused much uproar in the mainstream press was on the ‘secret’ $114 billion ($114,000,000,000) dollar bailout that was received by Canadian financial institutions, on an ongoing basis from 2008-2010 to keep Canadian banks from failing. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and Prime Minister Stephen Harper have been on record affirming to Canadian citizens that “there were no bailouts and Canadian banks are sound”. Well, the politicians were lying. Are you surprised?</p>

    <p class="indent">Many, including myself, were not shocked at all when the news came out about the one hundred billion ($100,000,000,000+) dollar Canadian bailout that occurred during the time of systemic financial instability beginning in 2008. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft21" id="fn21"><sup class="frac">21</sup></a> I had been hollering as loudly and often as possible to anyone who would hear me that in 2008 the Canadian government through the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation bailed out Canadian banks to the tune of seventy-five billion ($75,000,000,000) dollars. This was done by effectively taking mortgages that had gone belly up (had been unable to pay and become illiquid) off the balance sheet of the banks by putting them on the balance sheet of the public. The cover-up of this action had been pristine, indeed, when I had participated in an Economics debate at UBC, an old professor of mine had admitted to me she had not even known about the bailout. Maybe you did? Let’s think back to the time period in which it happened and we will see if you have any faint memories of it.</p>

    <p class="indent">It happened… 3 days before the federal election in 2008. Was this played out across the news and the mainstream press? Did a 75 billion ($75,000,000,000) dollar bailout--which in terms of the United States population would have been greater than their 700 ($700,000,000,000) billion TARP bailout--get any play in the media? The answer is an emphatic no. In my eyes, the amount of secrecy surrounding this stealth-bailout, in a self-professed open democracy, was simply pathetic. Considering the fact that this $75,000,000,000 will be necessarily paid by stealing wealth from each and every Canadian, the point that it was kept hushed up and received nearly zero airplay is truly a travesty and speaks volumes about how controlled the information average Canadians subscribing to the mainstream actually receive. I have to say though, I am not surprised. The day that Canada pulled out of the Kyoto protocol, I had watched the mainstream television’s news hour from start to finish, and the top news story of the day in Vancouver was of a bear that had crawled into a garbage removal truck. I couldn’t make this stuff up if I tried.</p>

    <p class="indent">On one hand it is simply saddening that the mainstream press has been such a complete failure in alerting Canadians about real issues. A free press was once a fundamental backbone of democracy and journalists were mavericks who would air the dirty laundry of the state and by doing so allowed citizens to hold their government responsible for their actions, like hundred billion dollar stealth bailouts. But on the other hand, beyond it just being a sad display of a lack of integrity in the media, what is can also be looked at is a huge and pressing danger, quantified in real world terms as millions of citizens living their lives completely in the dark, unaware of the real pressing issues that continue to threaten peoples’ livelihood on a day to day basis. What it means is that those who rely solely on the mainstream for the information by which they decide their course of action in life are going to be wholly unprepared and oblivious, and before long could possibly find themselves in an extremely desperate and painful time in their life. Those who listened to and believed Benjamin Shalom Bernanke, who as the head of the Federal Reserve told homeowners two weeks before the entire bubble collapsed that there was nothing to be afraid of, although they probably felt very warm inside for that limited period of time during which he spoke his lies, I doubt that they were very thankful after finding themselves in negative equity, drowning in debt. I doubt that they were very thankful when they were being forced out of their home, where if they couldn’t find shelter elsewhere were pushed onto the street to live homeless. I’m not sure if by now you are keeping a running list of “institutions who will not help you”, but if you are, be sure to jot down “the mainstream press”, right beside “the government” and “the banks”.</p>

    <p class="indent">When it is all put together, what this mass ignorance and oblivious nature of the masses really amounts to is a population whose exposure to a financial collapse is absolutely immense. We will begin to dig into the economic terms and the economic policies which have set us up for a failure of such spectacular proportions, but firstly know this: Most people who rely on the corporate media, the “#1 news story of the day being a bear in a garbage truck” media, will have no idea about the severity of the issue, or the degree to which it is truly impending. What I’m speaking about is not only severe, but also on the immediate horizon and quickly approaching. I am not trying to fear monger, but I made a commitment to myself and the reader at the outset of this project that I would not mince words or beat around the bush. I don’t need anything outside of the truth to make this story more alarming than it really is. However, I will not only paint the bad without supplying protective measures as well. My intention is not to have you close the book feeling panicked and anxious, but to close the book feeling encouraged that you now have a greater understanding of important topics with some initial pro-active steps to begin taking. There is great opportunity in change, and that is what this book is about foremost: very powerful and impending change. That part is coming, but first we must dive into the rabbit hole and see how deep it really takes us.</p>

    <p class="indent">Most people in our society, who are consistently fed either pointless information or purposeful misinformation, will sadly not hear your cries for an examination of our economic status quo. As someone who has a great deal of interest in psychology, and considering that this denial is a psychological matter, we can posit a few ideas for why this occurs. The 5 stages of denial come into the forefront of the mind, as does the idea of cognitive dissonance. The truth of the matter is that many people have too much invested in this system, are too far in debt, or have too much exposure to a mortgage, to heed your word and give a careful listen to what you, or I, or anyone else has to say. For whatever reason, these people have barricaded themselves in a reality where housing prices will only rise, where ‘our banks weren’t bailed out’, and where ‘this is different because this is Canada’. Sadly, this is perfectly typical of the situation I will describe that we are in, which is a massive financial asset bubble.</p>

    <p class="sec2"><span class="underline">FESTERING BUBBLES</span></p>

    <p class="indent">Once donned as “the maestro” but later exposed as a fledgling faux-academic who went on to admit that his entire financial outlook was based on flawed principles, then Federal Reserve Chairman (then most powerful man in the world) Alan Greenspan had some very relevant things to say about asset bubbles. While commenting on the Dot-com bubble, which saw people’s wealth evaporate in a scenario very similar to the United States’ most recent housing collapse, he summed up this inability to see the forest through the trees (i.e. reality), as “irrational exuberance”. If we can realize that history moves in cycles, in a circular motion as opposed to a linear motion, we can see that once again, history is repeating itself. We are living through yet another period of “irrational exuberance”, yet another financial bubble, where yet again people have covered their ears and eyes and will not submit to reality (yet).</p>

    <p class="indent">Perhaps after you have finished reading this book you will feel the need to run down the streets with your new found knowledge and warn every person of the upcoming financial collapse and what they can do to personally protect themselves. While this is morally commendable, it is not realistically viable, and all you will do in all likelihood is creep out some people out and tire yourself out. The best thing you can do, and all I recommend is this book, is to receive, digest and consider the information presented, and if it is found to be solid, and if your personal research on the topics verify what I am presenting, then at that point just think rationally and do what you must to prepare and protect yourself financially. I will give you what tips appear to me to be extremely viable and prudent, but ultimately this book’s purpose is in igniting interest and providing an intellectual foundation to understand world events. This chapter will hopefully act as a starting point in what will be for you a future period, and even era, of independent research and thought.</p>

    <p class="indent">What we are trying to create is alternative streams of information that can do battle against the distraction and infotainment of the mainstream media. Snooki’s latest outfit, Kim Kardashian’s latest spouse—these are things that receive much airplay and corporate attention, yet could not possibly be more irrelevant in terms of what will ultimately allow someone to live comfortably in the coming years. This is why it is so important, to ensure our survival as a people, to find better news sources than those supplied by the corporate media. CNN (Time Warner), ABC (Disney), Global (Shaw) and CTV (Bell) have no stake in whether or not you survive financially in the coming years. I, realistically, do not either, except that I do have a bit of living up to do now since you have purchased my book. Additionally, I am a person and not a ‘corporation’, and thus have more feeling and compassion since I am pursuing the enlightenment of the population, rather than a “pathological pursuit of profit” as UBC Law Professor Joel Bakan would describe it. With this being said, let us now examine a topic which will never, ever be discussed in the mainstream media, and this is the fact that the Soviet Empire of old and the current American Empire share some economic similarities that Uncle Sam does not want the masses to realize.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="center">“The governments don’t rule the world.</p>

      <p class="center">Goldman Sachs rules the world”</p>

      <p class="center">– Alessio Rastani</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">You may be surprised to hear it, but central planning was not only a major tenet of the economy of the Soviet Empire, but does in fact play a major role in the economy of the United States. This, of course, is antagonistic to what is usually proposed by most people who have only received the American government’s version of history throughout their life. Like ‘the land of the free’ with not only the highest total prison population in the world, but also the highest <em>per capita</em> prison population in the world, America is the ‘land of the free markets’ as far as a monopolistic corporate and banking sector dominated economy could be described as a free market. In fact, the Federal Reserve, which is the central bank of America, is itself a privately owned institution, whose stocks are privately owned and traded, although we do not know exactly by whom. This institution lends currency it creates out of thin air, with interest attached, to the United States government. And where does this currency come from to pay this interest? The answer to that is simple: the money comes from the people through taxation. Exactly how much money has the Federal Reserve lent to the United States government, or any handful of institutions around the world? The answer to that is that we simply do not know—their books, detailing all their lending is a black box, inaccessible to even the taxpayers who fund this scheme, or even the congress people for whom the Federal Reserve is supposedly accountable to.</p>

    <p class="indent">It takes little but a cursory glance at the function of the central bank to quickly understand that what has been devised is nothing more than a cash-generating scheme run by a conglomerate of wealthy interests. But already we are getting too far ahead of ourselves—I said that central planning was a main tenet of the American empire, and it is, but let’s examine how.</p>

    <p class="indent">Simply put, it comes down to interest rates. Although originally disallowed by the Christian religion, being even punishable by death, money lending with interest attached is now not only a basic tenet of our current financial system, but as we will begin to see in our examination—it is the entirety of our financial system. Debt, or as it is more euphemistically known as ‘credit’, is the fuel that turns the gears of our economy. And the banks are the almighty purveyor of this debt, which when overloaded in the 1920s caused the Great Depression, and when overloaded in 2007 caused the collapse of the United States and subsequently the rest of the world.</p>

    <p class="indent">If this is all new to you, it may in its novelty seem complex or complicated, believe me—it’s not. As with anything foreign, with new terms and ideas it seems so intricate and detailed, but as with anything simple and uncomplicated, after you familiarize yourself with the concepts you simply cock an eyebrow and ask “that’s it?”. By the end of this chapter, that is exactly what you will be doing, thinking “I thought it would be way more complicated than that”. So did I. So does everyone else who hasn’t taken the time out to actually sit down and take a crack at understanding the financial mumble jumble that comes through in the news. To be fair, it is hard to actually pick a starting point from which to dive in, so we are at least partly excused. Let’s first start with the misconception of the United States as a free, capitalistic economy, by conducting a side-by-side examination of the central planning of both the former Soviet Union and the current United States.</p>

    <p class="indent">A main feature of central planning is price controls. In a Soviet-style planned economy everything was priced from a central location—the price of bread, the price of milk and so forth. This is as opposed to a free market economy, in which the understanding is that the marketplace, through the laws of supply and demand, will generate the prices of the goods through the phenomenon of price discovery. Price discovery thus occurs when buyers and sellers are allowed freely to interact with no outside influence.</p>

    <p class="indent">The Federal Reserve of the United States controls the price of every item available for purchase in the American economy. Too large of a claim—how can I back it up? Well consider this: when simultaneously gas rises in price by 10%, bananas rise in price by 10% and a new pair of sneakers rise in price by 10%--what is happening? Are all of these items simultaneously rising in price, that is to say, the price to produce bananas, sneakers and petroleum are all rising independently, and it just so happens that they each rise in price by 10%?</p>

    <p class="indent">The obvious answer is that this is not true, but yet we have observed this exact phenomenon occur throughout history in economies all over the world. The fact is that these goods are not all rising in price simultaneously, but the currency in which they are using to purchase the good is in fact losing value, or <em>depreciating</em> in this example by 10% (remember inflation?). And in the United States, under the privately owned Federal Reserve, Benjamin Bernanke exerts an unyielding amount of influence over this depreciation of his fiat currency. As we’ve learned, he could, at his whim, fire up the printing presses and rain billions of dollars down on the country. (Bernanke is actually known as ‘Helicopter Ben’, after writing in an essay that to battle deflation the United States he could simply drop bundles of currency from helicopters<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft22" id="fn22"><sup class="frac">22</sup></a> —so I am not exaggerating when I say this.) Other than the printing press, he could simply punch a number on a computer and create $17,000,000,000,000 (17 trillion) in currency, which he has already done at least once during the crisis of 2008. But the most benign method by which Bernanke can create currency, which ultimately depreciates the dollar, the currency which every marketplace transaction in the United States uses, is by controlling from his central perch in the Federal Reserve the interest rates of the country.</p>

    <p class="indent">Currently, the Federal Reserve in New York is pursuing a <em>ZIRP</em> policy, or ‘zero-interest rate policy’. The thinking behind this, or at least the ostensible reason that is given for pursuing this policy, is that when interest rates are kept near zero this encourages firms (businesses) to take out loans from banks and begin contributing to the economy. Essentially, keeping interest rates as low as possible, and keeping low what is called in economics as the <em>opportunity cost</em>, that is the cost that is incurred to begin your business, is a way to kickstart a floundering economy. This is the general intellectual thought process that I have also encountered at the University of British Columbia. A more apt analogy than the kickstarting of a motor, however, would be that of a doctor, in this case Ben Bernanke, with a defibrillator trying to shock back to life a patient who will, despite the constant electric shocks, never return.</p>

    <p class="indent">The interest rate, or the rate at which money is lent, can also be called <em>the price of money</em>. When the interest rates are at zero, the money is essentially free. When the interest rate is low, at say 1% as is currently set by the Bank Of Canada (Canada’s central bank), the price of money could be said to be very cheap. The higher the interest rate, the higher the “cost” of money—and by controlling from a central location this very crucial economic tool, as opposed to letting the marketplace decide the interest rate, the Federal Reserve in New York is in fact controlling the entire economy. The primary philosophy behind central planning is that the mind of some suited men in New York can decide better what prices should be manually set to, as opposed to letting them be created in the marketplace through price discovery based on supply and demand. Suited men in a room in New York controlling the price of money itself is <em>not</em> free market capitalism. It is state-controlled capitalism, which rhymes much more with fascism than it does with a free society. Be very wary of those who are quick to place the blame of the total dysfunction of financial markets onto the academic school of thought called free market capitalism. Capitalism has certainly been abandoned across the world, what is alive today in the markets is proto-fascism, that is a merger of corporate and state powers, wearing a capitalistic mask.</p>

    <p class="indent">The idea of free markets, supply and demand, and competition has been certainly abandoned. Old, suited men in New York (for now) exert a far greater amount of control over markets than does the will of the public, and if we look at historical examples: fiat currencies plus an economy run by a small, elite clique equals, without variation equals collapse. The amount of time it takes to reach that ultimate collapse changes, but the eventual outcome never does. As all fiat currencies since the beginning of time have reached their ultimate conclusion by returning to their intrinsic value of zero, so do all economies run from a central location by a group of technocrats follow a similar trajectory. Add it to the list of ‘reasons why it is completely certain there will be a breakdown in the system’ and let’s keep moving on.</p>

    <p class="indent">Onto our next topic: How is it that these ‘economic whizzes’, the people put in charge of keeping an eye on the entire economy, supposedly to be able to warn the citizens they supposedly serve about economic turbulence that is headed their way are never able to do so? How is it that former Congressman Ron Paul in 2001 said “the Fed is now creating yet another bubble in the housing sector. This bubble, like all other bubbles will one day pop”, yet in 2007, just weeks before the bubble did finally explode, leaving millions of Americans devastated in its wake—how is it that during this time Bernanke was continuing to nod, smile, and affirm to the American people that the economy was strong, there was no bubble in housing, while forecasting “large sustained growth” during that period?</p>

    <p class="indent">Bush, in his usual laughable fashion, when asked about the economy in 2007 smiled, looked into the camera and said, with a Southern drawl “I’m not an economist”—as if it was a good thing, something he was proud of. After he felt the cold stiffness in the air and realized that the phrase was not as well received as he had imagined, he then lectured the journalist who had posed the question saying “and I can remember you people yelling recession this recession that, as if you’re economists when you’re not”. The economy from that point continued to crash, with entire neighbourhoods foreclosed upon and entire families pushed onto the street. That was America’s tipping point, and we can now look at where it has left them: <span class="strike">46,000,000</span> 48,000,000 Americans (a new record) surviving on food stamps as of July 2013; over 100,000,000 Americans without employment as of June 2012.</p>

    <div class="figure">

      <p class="caption"><em>Again, where is the ‘recovery’?</em></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">Based on this example alone, it illustrates the sheer idiocy of some to place such trust in the financial and political demagogues of their particular country. But it still does not answer our question: How is that those who are in the highest rank in the financial system, entrusted to oversee the entire economy, heralded as the ‘greatest economic minds in the world’, are the same who were unable to see a gigantic housing bubble that crippled an entire nation and even sent the entire world into a recession? This of course juxtaposed with others who were able to say with great certainty that the bubble would pop, even up to six years in advance.</p>

    <p class="indent">I cannot get too conspiratorial with this question, as I lack the hard evidence and would hate to base an idea off of conjecture alone, but there is one thing that is certain: central bankers will never tell the truth. They will continue to spread misinformation through the airwaves, telling the citizenry that there are no impending issues that they should concern themselves with, and after the financial explosion which ‘there was no way of foretelling’, they will say that the very foundation of our banking system is in danger, and that only by pumping taxpayer money into these dying, insolvent institutions can we avoid a second Great Depression. When Henry Paulson (who was nicknamed ‘The Snake’ while working for Goldman Sachs on Wall Street) was threatening the United States congress into passing their $700 billion Tarnished Asset Relief Program bailout package, Democrats and Republicans alike were told that if they failed to pass this bill there could be martial law on the streets of America. As Representative Brad Sherman of California said during the House Of Representative’s debate over TARP.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="block">“Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall, the market would fall two or three thousand points the first day, another two or three thousand points the second day and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no”</p>

      <p class="block">–Congressman Brad Sherman, <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft23" id="fn23"><sup class="frac">23</sup></a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">This is as opposed to Canada, where the bailout was simply passed without debate. But there’s more on that to come, first let’s examine the way in which central banks, but specifically the Federal Reserve of the United States and the Bank of Canada blow these asset bubbles which inevitably pop, leaving a mess of destruction in their wake, an experience which is particularly gruesome for the lower and middle classes.</p>

    <p class="sec2"><span class="underline">Savers vs Speculators</span></p>

    <p class="indent">By leaving interest rates at near zero (zero in the United States, 1% in Canada) what central bankers (central planners) are doing is encouraging people to take on debt. That is why the words that come out of Mark Carney’s mouth trying to dissuade Canadians from piling yet ever increasing amounts of debt onto their balance sheets is little more than political hogwash. People act on incentives, and when interest rates are kept at a virtually non-existent rates, what it encourages is people to take on debt. This is why there is said to be a war ongoing between savers and speculators. Savers, those with savings, usually seniors or pensioners, are slowly crippled as their returns on their savings are actually negative. Speculators and the largest ‘too-big-to-fail’ financial institutions make huge returns by the Ponzi-like amount of money that is pushed into financial assets such as houses and stocks. But since this is such a deep and important topic, let’s really make sure we have a handle on it, because make no mistake about it, there is a financial war going on right now—and savers are losing badly.</p>

    <p class="indent">Savers are getting their tails kicked for one simple reason: <em>negative real interest rates</em>. When granny sits her money in a bank she collects 1% interest (a return of 1% over a period of time on her deposit), when you factor in inflation, or the depreciation of the currency into the equation, what you will find is that as the currency sits in the bank, it is actually losing value. All we would need in terms of inflation is 2% yearly for Granny to now be losing 1% of the value of her savings. Every percent increase in inflation is just continued valued that is being bled out of the savings of those who need it most: those who are relying on their saved capital in old age, the subsistence which allows them to simply survive. The added blasphemy is that these are the people who acted financially prudent, worked hard, saved money, and tried to have money in the bank for their retirement. When you look at the demographics in Western cultures in terms of age, you realize that there are a lot of baby boomers facing retirement who are going to have a very rude awakening and a very tough time trying to cope in this era of literal financial repression.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="nonindent"><strong>Financial repression:</strong> A term that describes measures by which governments channel funds to themselves as a form of debt reduction.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft24" id="fn24"><sup class="frac">24</sup></a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">In an environment where there are negative real interests, and people lose value in their currency as it sits in a bank, saving is completely disincentivized and taking on ever increasing levels of debt is instead encouraged. Besides, it’s ‘free’ money—and if housing prices are going to do nothing but rise (according to the ‘demagogues), then where is the risk?</p>

    <p class="indent">The saddest thing about this all is that in Canada we are hearing the <em>exact</em>, verbatim words from the mouth of central bankers, economic pundits and real estate moguls alike—that housing prices will go nowhere but up. The reasons they cite may be different, but the message is the same: there is no risk, purchasing a house is a great investment, all you can do is profit.</p>

    <p class="indent">As a general rule of thumb: if someone tells you that there is no risk and that all you can do is profit—you are being taken for a ride. We have heard this historically again and again. It was the favourite phrase of clients of Bernard Maddoff’s, who was busted and thrown into jail for orchestrating the largest Ponzi-scheme (pyramid scheme) in the history of the United States. What you were supposed to do as a client was keep your mouth shut, not ask questions, put in ‘x’ amount of dollars and <em>all you could do was profit.</em> He was hailed by Wall Street and pundits alike as a ‘market maker’. That is, until it was found out that he was doing absolutely nothing in terms of making markets; that all he was doing was taking money from new suckers to pay off the old suckers all while growing a pyramid scheme larger and larger and larger until the whole thing collapsed. And that is exactly what will happen in housing in Canada, just like it happened to the housing in the United States—once the pool of naïve buyers entering the market and bidding up house prices begins to dry up, the pyramid scheme collapses.</p>

    <p class="indent">Let’s look at this in another way. What happens when Canadians are encouraged en masse to take on ever increasing amounts of debts to purchase assets, things such as mortgaged houses, new cars, clothing—whatever they can get their hands on? Well, let’s look specifically at the example of housing, since it is my belief that that this mass-debt induced shopping spree is setting up Canadians for a cataclysmic fall. Consumer debt is already pushing record levels of <span class="strike">150%</span> <span class="strike">154%</span> <span class="strike">162%</span> 164.7% debt to income. This is referred to by those in the corporate-banker-politician propaganda paradigm as sustainable, however I will show you the theoretical framework for proving how this debt, as opposed to being ‘sustainable’, is more akin to holding onto a cliff by the edge of your fingernails. On that note, it is time for a thought experiment!</p>

    <p class="indent">Suppose you, and I, and everyone else we know are taking advantage of these <em>record all-time low interest rates</em> set by the Bank of Canada, and the corresponding <em>record all-time low mortgage rates</em> given out by the Big 5 banks of Canada. What we will rationally do, when there is an incentive to partake in this action (keep an eye out for billboards advertising record-low interest rates), is take out a mortgage and ‘purchase’ a home. So now a $200,000 house is able to be purchased by any and everyone. We will talk about sub-prime mortgages in a bit, but when I mean everyone I really do mean everyone—every Walmart greeter is now in the market for what used to be, say a $200,000 house. What we see is that the pool of buyers who can potentially purchase that $200,000 house begins to expand at a rapid pace. Where once the house was only able to be purchased by those who could afford a mortgage with 20% down, and a 5% yearly interest rate over 30 years, what we now find is anyone is able to purchase a home, with 0% down and a 3% interest rate over 40 years. (After the bubble began to balloon, actions were taken by the Finance Minister to end 0% down 40 year mortgages, but they were widely popular during the early 2000s when the bubble really began to take off.)</p>

    <p class="indent">By now the demand for this $200,000 home has increased by a huge factor, and these massive amounts of people, all taking on mortgages and all looking for a home continues to push that $200,000 home up in price via bidding wars. Higher and higher they push it. In Toronto, based on bidding wars alone, homes have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars above their asking price. Before long, that $200,000 is now a $250,000 house—and then a $300,000 house. There is nothing of <em>value</em> in that house that has increased by 50%, no productive capacity or market fundamentals that say that this house is worth an extra $100,000; the price is simply and fundamentally built on a pedestal of debt. Now, this seems to be a good theory, but like all theories, it must be found in the data and evidence to have any real authenticity—otherwise it is just some person spouting nonsense. So, is it found in the data, that cheap debt is the driver of house prices in a bubble?</p>

    <p class="indent">One of the greatest minds in regards to examining the flaws of our current economic system is an Australian economics professor named Steve Keen. He is now hailed as one of the people who called the housing crash of America long in advance of it happening, and despite facing harsh rhetoric for being a negative-Nancy during the years of the boom when he was warning about the dire finale they would inevitably face, now he is given the proper recognition as one the few people who nailed it most perfectly. (Teaser: He has also called for the crash of both the Australian housing bubble and the Canadian housing bubble).</p>

    <p class="indent">Professor Keen has done extensive work covering the growth of debt and its effect on housing prices, and has written what is in my eyes a seminal work, ‘<em>Debunking Economics’</em>, in which I agree with critic Edward Fullbrook’s description that “no book poses a bigger threat to the faith of economics”. In this book, and in lectures which can be viewed on YouTube, he has found that there is a <em>80% correlation between rising debt levels and rising house levels. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft25" id="fn25"><sup class="frac">25</sup></a></em> Using data from Statistics Canada, capital management firm Pacifica Partners were able to plot rising housing prices, GDP growth and credit expansion all on a single graph.</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/92-1.jpg" /></p>

      <p class="caption">Source: Pacifica Partners <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft26" id="fn26"><sup class="frac">26</sup></a></p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">What was found was that housing prices have a real tendency to mimic the rise of credit expansion within Canada. This is exactly what creates a housing bubble: debt. When Walmart greeters are in the market bidding on houses and driving their prices to insane levels, a bubble is born, that is to say, people are buying financial assets not worth the money they are paying, and paying with money they do not have (and never will have). It truly sets up the stage for economic mayhem.</p>

    <p class="indent">I remind you again, that although there were lots of people calling out as loud and in as much earnest as they possibly could about the housing bubble and its inevitable crash in the United States, they were brushed aside as people who simply ‘weren’t American’, or were just ‘downers’ and ‘pessimists’. What they really were though were wise and realists, and trying to do everything they desperately could to warn people about the imminent danger.</p>

    <p class="indent">The people who were absolutely blind to the growth of the housing bubble, and gave zero warnings were the central bankers: Greenspan and Bernanke, the people who were in charge of looking over the economy and supposedly were in place to protect the everyday person (you and me). They could not see it whatsoever, they did zero to stop its growth, and they did not save a single person from financial devastation. A week before the entire housing bubble blew up and precipitated the greatest depression since THE Great Depression, Bernanke warned that there may be <em>some issues</em> with the housing market. Steve Keen and others had been warning about it since its inception, years in advance.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now what does this tell us? It tells us that no one is going to ride in at the last second and save us. Or at least, the politicians and those whose supposed responsibility it is to warn us of great economic tidal waves will not do a single thing about it, including and especially my economics professors. When the entire thing crashes, they will most likely blame it on something completely irrelevant, and claim it was ‘totally unforeseen’. What I am telling you right now is that it is not completely unforeseen, they are lying to you; it has been a long time coming.</p>

    <p class="indent">The housing situation, however, is just the proverbial ‘tip of the iceberg’. Lurking under the water is something far more sinister and dangerous. As we know now, the entire financial system has been set to be run in a reality that is no longer physically possible at this point, that being the era of infinite growth based on infinite oil extraction. Meanwhile, in a collective folly (based on the Bank Of Canada’s incentives), Canadians have loaded themselves up with debt—debt they will never be able to repay. The average consumer debt in Canada is one of the worst in the world: worse than even Greece and almost all of the countries whose financial turmoil we hear about in the news. Currently it sits at a record of 164.7% debt to income, meaning that Canadians collectively would have to work an entire year and a half, with no expenses (food, water), no taxes, nothing—just to pay off their debt. And with the current trends of continuing debt expansion in an environment of economic slowdown, I can tell you with full certainty: it’s not going to happen.</p>

    <p class="indent">Canadians have been given something which amounts to a backhanded blessing, which is the degradation of the country directly south of them. Beyond the very real human suffering and agony, a picture has been painted of what a Western, prosperous, developed country can quickly turn into in the wake of financial destruction brought about by a massive collapse in an asset bubble. What we have seen over these past four years is a country brought to its knees. Where once pride and prosperity were the descriptions ascribed to America, those sentiments have since been replaced by shame, poverty and destitution. To the forty-six million (48,000,000) Americans who survive now only on food stamps issued by the government, they understand all too well the gravity of the situation. If they were not awake to the reality of finance before the collapse hit, then they most certainly are now. Even still, like was the case of the woman in Cleveland I mentioned earlier in the book, these people are still floating in a sea of uncertainty, relying mostly on baseless hope than they are on any strategy for securing their financial and therefore their biological security. Their lives hang in the balance, and the stakes could not be higher—yet these were many of the people who felt so cozy and safe, living in their home which was only rising in price, feeling secure when they were being told those prices could only continue to rise.</p>

    <div class="blockquote">
      <p class="nonindent">Why are Canadians still fast asleep?</p>

      <p class="nonindent">Do they not realize they too are next on the chopping block?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="indent">I blame it on the ‘mushroom information’ strategy employed by the mainstream media, that is: keep Canadians in the dark and feed them feces. It is so rare that it is practically unheard of for someone to get on television and actually tell the people the truth about economic matters. Even with reading this book, you have purchased and are receiving this information from a source which has nothing to do with mainstream television or corporate media stations. You reading this book is essentially breaking through the matrix of the mainstream, an action which in today’s day and age is the only, <em>only</em> way to survive. Sadly, however, we cannot take this book or Keen’s ‘Debunking Economics’ or Heinberg’s ‘The Party’s Over’ etc and put a copy on the table of every single household in Canada and then force the occupants to read it. Thus, like I have mentioned before, we must act on this knowledge and be self-focused and self-directed.</p>

    <p class="indent">As a Canadian born citizen, raised in Canada who has lived in Canada all of my life, there is a special precedent I feel for portraying to my fellow countrymen, family and friends, just exactly what is happening currently in the world and why it is so dangerous. If during my research I hadn’t come across such ugly truths, such dire forecasts and such troubling news, then I would most certainly be spending my time in a different way. And although there is obviously no easy ‘one-fix’ solution, the truth of the matter is that there is still time to act. That is why I have said for Canadians the collapse of America has been a blessing, because to those of us who would heed it, it has been a warning. There is no law that says everyone must be hurt by the financial calamity headed our way, indeed steps can be taken to avoid it nearly entirely. Sadly, from just a realistic point of view we can understand that most people <em>will</em> be hurt by it because sadly, the masses will not be able to react in time. They are not spending their time researching, learning and preparing—they are spending their time digging; digging themselves deeper into a hole while storm clouds gather (if you can imagine where that will lead them). What can be done to protect ourselves collectively I will cover in the final chapter of the book, where I will make my projections for the future. But in the meantime, let me continue to set the stage and supply more background information surrounding the failure of our financial system.</p>

    <p class="indent">During my time of writing this on May 7<sup class="frac">th</sup> of 2012, news had just come out that in February, the total size of the Canadian economy had actually shrunk. The sectors which had been diminished in size included oil, natural gas and manufacturing, by a collective total of 1%. These losses were offset by gains in the areas of banking and insurance. I have spoken about this quite extensively in a commentary videos I have put on YouTube, but let me just sum it up this way: as we already know, our economic system relies on constant growth for survival, so a reduction in size is already bad enough. It means we are hitting some hard limits—but this is where the news becomes worse. The sectors that were <em>reduced</em> in size were <em>oil, natural gas</em> and <em>manufacturing;</em> the <span class="underline">real</span> economy. The sectors that <em>expanded</em> were <em>finance, insurance</em> and <em>real estate.</em> This hollowing out of a real economy, only to be replaced by a financial industry which produces absolutely nothing, is symptomatic of an economy on the verge of collapse. This is the exact trend that was followed in the United States before not only the so-called ‘Great Recession’ of the late 2000s, but also directly before the Great Depression. When the financial sector reaches a certain point of size in the economy, two huge events happen: inequality is raised to such limits it creates two classes, historically serfs and landlords and it simultaneously sets up the economy for a large crash. This news alone does not mean that we are sitting on the precipice of collapse—but it means we are moving in that direction.</p>

    <p class="indent">During that same day of May 7<sup class="frac">th</sup>, a report had also come out from the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives, a think-tank based in Vancouver which I must applaud for breaking through mainstream misinformation by producing well constructed academic studies analyzing economics in Canada. In this most recent report by the CCPA, they had researched and detailed the extent of the Canadian bailouts of financial institutions that occurred from 2008-2010. They include details about the insolvency of the Big 5 Canadian banks: CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, BMO and TD Canada Trust. Revealed were some startling realities, including the fact that CIBC in 2008 was actually so underwater and insolvent, that the amount of bailout funds that they received actually eclipsed the actual worth of the business. Put another way, it would have been cheaper for us as a nation to just purchase every single stock of CIBC and own it outright, than it would have been for us to pump funds into it to allow it survive on its own. Also detailed in this report are the billions of dollars that were paid from the Federal Reserve in New York to these insolvent institutions to keep them afloat.</p>

    <p class="indent">Many Canadians (though not nearly enough) were well aware of the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation and the $75 ($75,000,000,000) billion dollars of taxpayer money (collected from you and I) that was paid to these institutions to keep them from failing.<a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft21"><sup class="frac">21</sup></a> Let me digress and explain this a bit further. In 2008, during the time of panic and economic collapse, many risky mortgages that banks had lent out began to go belly-up. What this amounted to was a lot of banks losing a lot of money. However, many of these mortgages were insured through the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation, a publicly (meaning you and I) owned corporation. When these mortgages began to go belly-up, lest the banks actually face any losses, it was decided that the Canadian taxpayer would bail out these banks to the tune of $75 billion dollars. Adjusting for population, that is larger than the amount paid out in the Tarnished Assets Relief Program in America, which received international media attention, all day everyday during the entirety of the <em>debate</em> as to whether or not it would go through. In Canada, it was hushed up and with little to no public scrutiny and simply pushed through.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, let me return to this point. I was aware of the $75 billion dollar bailout (although not at the time it occurred), and I was also aware that the Federal Reserve paid out over $17 trillion (17,000,000,000,000) dollars in secret loans to corporations and banking institutions all over the world (which I had assumed involved Canada). So contrary to being surprised by the ‘revelation’ of these bailouts, I was just happy they were finally getting media attention. However, I had severely underestimated the magnitude of these cash injections. The details around these insane wealth transfers are still fuzzy as the details let out by the CHMC and the Bank of Canada have been lacking at best, and muzzled at worst. Before this study conducted by the CCPA, I also had a sneaking suspicion that many of our Canadian banks were insolvent, that is, if people went belly-up with their mortgages or went to withdraw their savings in any degree of magnitude, the banks would be forced to declare that they simply didn’t have the money, and would have to fold as an institution--remember the reality of fractional reserve banking. To cover these losses incurred by people’s mortgages going belly up, around 20 times more collateral would have to be put up, which these banks would have to obtain by selling assets they owned.</p>

    <p class="indent">Stephen Harper on June 5<sup class="frac">th</sup> 2012, while giving an interview on CBC’s The National said some very interesting things, that if you were listening with carefully and with a trained ear, you could have picked up. Unfortunately, I imagine most Canadians only clued into that which Harper, the ever careful phrase constructer would want them to hear. However, if you were able to read between the lines, he quite clearly laid out his foundation for any future calamity that may be born out of financial collapses in Europe. He will bail out the banks—again, and without hesitation. He will continue to prop up the failed financial institutions, which siphon wealth from the lower and middle classes, saddling them with debt when the times are good, and demanding handouts from them when the times turn bad. To keep this book focused, I will simply not be able to delve as deeply as necessary to be able to back this claim fully by evidence, but we are living in a nation occupied by banks. As of the crimes of Richard Cheney, it is a topic that warrants a full blown exposé, but this book is not the place for that examination to happen.</p>

    <p class="indent">Hopefully, if by the end of this book you find it to be of value and worth, and recommend its purchase to a friend or two, I will be brought closer to a paradigm in which I can dedicate myself full-time to my passion: alerting those who will listen to the most important of information I have learned in my incessant research, and the exposing treachery. But alas, the latter must be postponed, as we still have extremely crucial information that must be understood and distributed. Onward!</p>

    <div class="figure">
      <p class="center"><img alt="image" src="../Images/ding.jpg" /></p>
    </div>

    <p class="nonindent">The world is currently awash in debt, and as I have pointed out before: <em>there is absolutely no growth scenario in which these debts can be paid</em>. Ask Greece about that. They were given their first bail-out on an assumption that their economy would grow by a certain percent. According to the calculations of some bureaucrats, with the assumed percentage in economic growth, the bail-out would at some foreseeable point be able to be paid back. What was found instead was that the economy, in fact, continued to shrink with negative growth. Before long they were on the chopping block, with <em>yet another</em> bailout placed on the table. Today, they continue to hang in the balance with only two dire options in front of them: to either accept further bailouts moving deeper into debt and remaining in the Eurozone, or to default on the debt and leave the Eurozone completely. At this point political will is holding together the idea that Greece can remain in the Eurozone, despite more realistic observations which point towards Greece being forced to leave the Eurozone and introduce its own currency. However, increasingly ideas are coming together to form the Eurozone into a political rather than solely a monetary union. It is this renewed ‘economic integration’ that raises eyebrows but is being pushed vehemently by technocratic bankers, who have often been plugged into major positions of power after leaving the ever powerful bank of Goldman Sachs.</p>

    <p class="indent">But dare I repeat it again: <em>There is <span class="underline">no</span> growth scenario in which these debts can be paid.</em> Many developed, Western countries have sovereign debts (debts owed to other nations) in which the <em>interest</em> generated on the debts alone is now larger than all tax revenues. These countries have debts which are quickly eclipsing the total size of their country’s GDP and continue to grow in exponential fashion.</p>

    <p class="indent">However, even these sovereign debts are not even the biggest threat to the financial system. (Now it is time we enter into the Twilight zone). These sovereign debts are rather easy to imagine and quantify. It is absolutely foolish to think on the whole that it is an effective strategy to incur further debt to pay off already existing debt. I can’t do it, you can’t do it, and countries can’t do it either. That is a simple concept to grasp and although it is impossible for us to imagine what 16 trillion ($16,000,000,000,000) dollars of debt looks like, which is the current national debt of the United States federal government, to compare it with the size of the <em>derivatives</em> market is like comparing a housecat to a lion.</p>

    <p class="indent1">Derivatives as a financial innovation have sealed the fate of the financial system. It is not a question of ‘if’ this whole thing is going to blow up; it is a question of when. Let’s compare some figures, just for our own personal entertainment:</p>

    <p class="indent">Holy fiat! Now the most pressing question is: what the hell is a derivative! A derivative is simply a bet. Yes, it is entirely possible that there is a $700 trillion dollar market based on nothing but betting conducted on Wall Street. It is completely unsettling when you realize that this thing is at least eleven times larger than the entire world economy and is held up by stilts, those stilts being the insolvent ‘too big to fail’ institutions that we have come to <span class="strike">know and love</span> hate and despise. It is not only completely possible, but is--unfortunately for those who will bear the brunt of the impact when it collapses—a material reality. Another thing you should know is that the entire derivatives market takes place in the ‘shadow banking sector’—meaning it is entirely secret; a black box if you will. There was once talk of bringing the derivatives market into the public domain, out of the secret shadow banking sector, and breaking up the too big to fails, but those ideas have long since passed. The only way to deal with it now is for it to wait for the too big to fails to fail, survive the associated depression and start anew. This will amount to a ‘Great Reset’, and from this point the world will have to create a new kind of banking system. However, to call a derivative a bet, although it is a great analogy and nearly summarizes these ‘financial innovations’ perfectly, isn’t a satisfying explanation for us. On that note, let’s look deeper.</p>

    <p class="indent">A derivative is more accurately a contract that is entered into by two parties. A derivative contract can be taken out on anything, really—anything. Common things that derivative contracts are entered into include betting on… the weather. But also, and more importantly: housing prices. If you and I were to enter a derivatives contract, and for example I were to say that the price of the house that a friend of ours lives in—I guess now is a good point to mention that a special aspect regarding derivatives is you don’t have to actually own the thing you are betting on. In this example, we make a bet based on the price of this house. I say that it is going to decline, and then we enter a contract. Realistically, I would enter this contract because I had some stake that would be lost if the housing price declined. That’s why derivatives are called ‘securitizations’, and are sometimes looked at as a form of insurance (that is what they were actually created to do—to protect against risk. Imagine that.) Today, however, they are the ticking time bomb whose eventual and inevitable detonation will have implications that we today can simply not imagine.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now, if the housing market declines, you have to pay me out, depending on the stipulations of the contract. But in the meantime, while we are watching the housing prices, although we are basing our model of the future as if you have the money and are going to 100% certainly pay me out, the reality is that until the money lands in my pocket, all there is simply is an IOU. That is how this whole thing has blown up to such enormous sizes. There is no collateral at all in these bargains. Just like there is no collateral for the dollars we are given by banks or anything else. There is simply nothing there. Now, I will digress into a point that I’ve been waiting to make for a long time.</p>

    <p class="center1"><em>THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS A<br />
    GOD DAMN PONZI SCHEME!</em></p>

    <p class="indent">A pyramid scheme, a rip-off, a fraud, a sham--no analogy better describes the entire current financial system, because no single thing better personifies the current financial system. It is all a game, a rigged pyramid scheme, built on a foundation of money printed out of thin air. The money is not really there, it does not really exist. The only productive capacity that truly exists is created by those who are working, who are producing something with real labour, but as soon as that labour has produced something, it is converted into a currency with zero collateral, a Ponzi-scheme building based on a foundation of paper with ‘IOU’ windows.</p>

    <p class="indent">When you pick up the magnifying glass and look a little deeper at the economy and the financial system, you find that there’s nothing there. It’s a mirage, a hoax, a joke, a pulling of the leg of the middle class. It’s an illusion, propped up by reality television cameras and a hoping that nobody peeks behind the curtain to see what’s actually going on. A hope that nobody asks where there money is going, and that everyone stays shut up, complacent and docile. That is, until the last vestiges of real wealth have been stolen from the society, until they pull out the rug from under us and in one fell swoop of their magic trick ask us “Want to see a generation disappear?” This is the trend, this is what is happening.</p>

    <p class="indent">The ‘bailouts’ of the ‘too-big-to-fails’ were nothing more than an act of thievery. It was a blatant theft of the wealth of the working class to let live a banking cartel which has permeated through and blatantly taken over the governments once assumed to work for the people, but have since been obviously overtaken. To paint the picture of this, consider the fact that out of all the ‘recovery’ seen from the bailout in the United States 37% of the recovered capital has gone to the top 0.1% of income earners, 56% of the recovered capital has gone to the rest of the top 1% of income earners and the other 7% has gone to the remaining 99%. <a href="../Text/bib.htm#ft27" id="fn27"><sup class="frac">27</sup></a></p>

    <p class="indent">These ‘bailouts’ were not about rescuing the economy. This blatant robbery was about rescuing the banks, so that when the last edifices of the financial system collapse, and the entire paradigm comes tumbling down, they will be safe enough, barricaded away with a police force which they can still afford to pay to beat up and arrest their fellow working men and women. To call this rigged system a Ponzi-scheme may appear to be fun in a name-calling sense, but I sincerely mean it in a literal fashion. To prove my point, we will take a look at the largest Ponzi-scheme ever run in American history and you will be forced to agree with me. And with that being said, let’s examine in more detail exactly what a Ponzi-scheme is, it’s specific characteristics, so we can in fact come to the conclusion that <strong>yes</strong>, this whole system is one big Ponzi-scheme and will therefore share the fate of all other Ponzi-schemes before it.</p>

    <p class="indent">In 2008 former investor Bernard Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison (his release date is in 2149) for defrauding those who were ‘investing’ with him of <em>billions</em> of dollars. It was a typical pyramid scheme—the money taken from those who were just entering the scheme was used to pay-off those who had been in the racket for a long time. Nothing was being produced, no real investments nor ‘market making’ as Madoff would later call it was actually happening. All that was happening was a money transfer, from those at the bottom of the pyramid all the way up to those at the top. The idea of a pyramid or Ponzi-scheme, is not by any stretch of the imagination a new idea. Bernie Maddoff’s just happened to be the largest in United States history. But let’s examine some of the characteristics of a Ponzi-scheme and keep an eye out for any parallels you see with our current banking and economic system:</p>

    <p class="indent">Foremost: it requires infinite growth. For returns to be paid out to the original ‘investors’, there must always be an infinite amount of new suckers that will come to the table. In Madoff’s example, he needed a constant amount of new customers investing their funds in him. If this steady influx of money did not continue to come in, he would not be able to pay those who paid into the system early, and the whole thing would collapse. To continue siphoning the profits off of the top, he needed a continued and infinite pool of incoming money.</p>

    <p class="indent">Secondly: There is no collateral. In real investment, you are supposed to buy tangible items, commodities: stocks, metals, wheat, etc. Things with real value. In a Ponzi-scheme, there is no collateral. All that exists is stolen wealth that is funnelled from one place to another. There is no true banking occurring, that is, deposits from investors being lent to entrepreneurs. In a Ponzi-scheme, the whole thing is just a large wealth transference.</p>

    <p class="indent">Thirdly: The entire thing is based on the premise of trust. When Bernie Madoff was running his Ponzi-scheme, people thought he was a star investor. They didn’t know how he could consistently have such over-the-top returns, but those who were investing in him did not care to know how. They knew the rule of the game—put in, shut up, collect your cheque at the end of the month and don’t ask questions. As soon as people DID start to ask questions, the entire thing came tumbling down, and those who were once believed to be rich and making great returns on their money came to face a harsh reality: There was no money, there was no real wealth—it had all been ‘evaporated’, or rather, transferred to someone else who got into the game before them.</p>

    <p class="indent">The parallels between Bernie Madoff and our current system are astounding. This is because they are the exact same thing. Sadly, the entire world is going to feel the effects of the collapse of the United States dollar Ponzi-scheme, and most people will have no time to take any steps to protect themselves against it. Unfortunately, many lives will be devastated, and undoubtedly many lives will be lost. Just like in the United States, the middle class had the bottom fall out from under them in an instant—this same phenomenon will continue to happen en masse, across the world.</p>

    <p class="indent">It is not difficult to see what financial ruin on a personal level can do to a country when it happens en masse. We only need to look towards the United States, formerly the world’s sole and supreme super-power after the collapse of the Soviet Union, now the world’s largest debtor nation with 100,000,000 without employment and 48,000,000 surviving on food stamps. The pain being felt there is very real, and the situation is extremely perilous. Ironically, those people who are hurting most now are the same ones who only a handful of years ago felt extremely secure. If we could look back to 2006, we would see a nation in what appeared to be an economic hey-day. Housing prices across the nation were continuing to rise, which was day in and day out pointed towards by Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, as an indicator of economic strength. Wealth was easy to be found—all that was simply needed was a mortgage. With little to no money down, people were purchasing up swaths of real estate and watching with great optimism as the price continued to soar. The thinking then was not whether or not you could afford to buy a house; the thinking was whether or not you could afford NOT to buy a house.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now read this story and see if with our newfound knowledge of asset bubbles, leveraged mortgages and Ponzi-schemes, and see if any alarm bells start ringing. Here is the scenario: It is 2005 in America. Encouraged by record low interest rates, you decide to take on a $195,000 mortgage, with $5000 down. You then find a home and purchase it for $200,000. Everyone else in the neighbourhood is doing the same thing, as soon as homes go up for sale they are instantly sold, often with a bidding war, the final price ends up being significantly higher than the original asking price. Old homes, in good condition, are torn down to make way for larger more expensive homes.</p>

    <p class="indent">The ‘value’ (price) of your home continues to climb and climb. Without much time elapsing, your home has now risen in price from $200,000 to $300,000. You did little to nothing, simply purchasing the home and sitting on it as the value rose, yet it would appear with your investment of extremely little ($5000) you had now “made” $100,000. Imagine the sense of security you would feel, sitting on an expensive home in which you were told the value would only continue to rise, in a neighbourhood full of new construction and new purchases. If you weren’t digging too hard or thinking too much, it would seem you had hit the jackpot. Indeed, as is the norm with those who head central banks, the Chairman in oversight of the entire financial system, Ben Bernanke, would continue to come out and repeat that this time the prosperity would never end, “this time the technology had pulled out us into a new financial paradigm, where prices could only rise and there were only winners”. His words are an added sense of security and make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.</p>

    <p class="indent">Now fast forward two years. Ben Bernanke is still telling you that the US economy has never been stronger and that high housing prices are a good bedrock foundation for this powerful economy. But then something a little bit odd begins to happen. People who hadn’t read the fine print of their mortgages are facing a harsh realization: their interest rates limits weren’t locked in. They had signed off on variable-rate mortgages, and now they saw their interest rates on their mortgages begin to take off, and the monthly costs take off along with it. All of a sudden, people in your neighbourhood are going belly-up with their mortgages. Unable to pay their largely increased mortgage payments, in a time when oil is topping out at $147 a barrel, people begin to default on their mortgages. Homes are foreclosed upon and sit vacant. All of a sudden, the ‘value’ (but really only the price) of your home begins to decline. As you are sitting in your house a breaking news story comes across the television screen: These sub-prime mortgages that people are beginning to default on are not held at the banks which issued them. They were chopped up, bundled together, and sold all over the world. All of a sudden banks across the world realize they may be insolvent. The country slips into a depression.</p>

    <p class="indent">There is economic turmoil, all of a sudden news of failing banks are catapulted to the top of the news hour, and hold firm the attention of the international media. In these panicked times, people hold onto their money and refuse to take on more debt. The very thing that fuelled the rise in houses ceases—people are no longer taking on further mortgages to purchase homes, and even if they would like to, there is a credit freeze as the banks have stopped loaning money.</p>

    <p class="indent">Meanwhile you are stuck with this home, declining in price but still safely above the $200,000 at which you purchased it. You put it up for sale, deciding you are going to get out while the going is good. But so do a lot of other people on your block. ‘For Sale’ signs pop up all over the neighbourhood. But there are no buyers. It becomes a total ‘buyers market’—the people who <em>do</em> have money for homes, and can buy with outright cash, are purchasing homes for far <em>below</em> the asking price. Meanwhile, amid a sea of vacant, foreclosed homes, you see the value of your home continue to decline. -20%.., -30%… before you know it you reach that magic number: $200,000. And before you know it, you are well below it—your initial $5000 has been evaporated, you are now in the negative and falling.</p>

    <p class="indent">*Snap snap* Now back to the present.</p>

    <p class="indent">While this may seem like a horror plot, this was all too real for millions across the United States. It has not been uncommon for neighbourhoods to lose <em>90%</em> of their value. The median housing price in Detroit is now <span class="strike">$8000</span> $6000 dollars. For most people, working, watching television and drinking beers, the thing which was such a sure bet, such a bedrock foundation of financial security, ended up being a burden like none other. The unrealistic, if not greedy gains made on the rise of your housing prices are now eclipsed by a huge unpayable debt. God forbid you were the last in the game, the last sucker in the Ponzi-scheme, who purchased their house at the peak, before the devastation occurred. Do realize that this debt and greed fuelled asset bubble destruction was <em>exactly</em> what caused the Great Depression. History certainly moves in cycles.</p>

    <p class="indent">In the final chapter, we will touch on the topic of asset bubbles yet again—this time to see how to protect ourselves from them. As we know now, an asset bubble is a simple economic term meaning an asset which sees its price (but not its true value) rise to levels which are way out of touch with reality. There were no market forces that were causing these houses to ascend in price so quickly; that is, they were not actually rising in true value with the same speed in which the price rose. Thus, the explanation of what caused the housing bubble seen in the United States in 2008 is extremely simple, if you can understand the function debt has in our society.</p>

    <p class="indent">Nonetheless, there is a constant argument about the spawn of bubbles: some say it is human nature and that herd mentality and greed fuel them. Others say that it is the predatory nature of banking institutions, who to make a quick profit will peddle debt on those they know can never repay. Either way, most people simply participate in their creation without even realizing it, and then suffer the consequences when the tide turns. These people are usually left with empty pockets, cursing the heavens and asking “God, why?!” We know too well of stockbrokers in the Great Depression leaping from buildings, having lost their entire life’s work in the matter of days. It is truly tragic.</p>

    <p class="indent">Regardless of where the fault lies for the creation of bubbles, by understanding some simple economics we can take actions which can protect ourselves. Knowing the game in which you are playing will be the difference between being a large net-loser in the future or a large net-gainer. Sadly, not everyone will be able to be educated in time—the distraction matrix is just too strong within our culture. However, we have a foremost responsibility to ourselves, our friends and our family to try and spread the knowledge, spread the understanding, and take actions with the long-term in mind that will help protect ourselves. This examination of our economic system was by no means an exhaustive one, but more a crash course, a ‘101 In What You Need To Know To Get Your Feet On The Ground’. I hope it has served its purpose in that regard and not only gave you the foundation to begin your own research, but perhaps lit a fire, a passion to begin to learn about these things on your own.</p>

    <p class="indent">But like I have said at the outset of this book: this is not a book on economics (if you can believe it). This is a book based on a much larger premise, which is the fact that we are stuck in the middle of the ‘knee of the bend’ of an exponential world. The exponential depletion of resources on our planet, the exponential growth of human population, of debt in our economic system: these are all just symptoms of a much larger physical reality taking place. And that is the fact that time itself is slowing down.</p>

    <p class="indent">Does it seem like more world events have happened in this last year than any before it? That the pace of the world seems to keep picking up—revolutions, banking collapses, resource depletions—is it just our perception that makes it seem like more is happening? Actually—no. Your perception is picking up on a very real and very forceful trend, one which involves physics, chaos theory and the least of which: technology. It is due time we begin what may not only be the most technical, but the most exciting and important kind of exponential growth which is the actual exponential slowing down of time itself. Let’s begin.</p>
